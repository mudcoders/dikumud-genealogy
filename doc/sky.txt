--- This has been modified and edited from sky.txt in the Envy 2.0 release to
    reflect changes made from the Envy 2.0 source to Mythran.
     
=== Blue Sky

It's blue sky time!  These are features we'd like to have in Envy.  We haven't
designed them, haven't coded them, haven't scheduled them.  They won't be in
Envy 2.0 and may never be in Envy.

If you code any of these features please send us a copy.



=== Symbolic Names in Numeric Fields.

We'd like 'fread_number' to understand words such as AFF_SANCTUARY and
translate them into the appropriate numbers.

-- Instead of changing fread_number to read in AFF_SANCTUARY, we've changed
fread_string to read in a character "number" and store into a numeric field.
Though this requires a modification on all the area files in EnvyMud, the
added flexibility was useful.



=== New Comm Drivers

Right now comm.c understands only Berkeley Unix networking.  We'd like comm
drivers for the following operating systems:

	System V Unix
	VMS
	OS/2   (single user)
	FOSSIL (for dialup Envy on bbs's)



=== Randomization on Area Loading

We'd like to see items loaded with random spells, placed on random mobs, so
that players have to explore more instead of just having a '#blue' macro that
goes to the queen spider and kills her for a blue potion.



=== Envy-to-Envy Portals

The save files are ASCII -- just shoot it over a server-to-server connection.



=== Protection Against Multi-Playing

RFC 1413 is a good protocol but no one implements it.  :(



=== Built-in Client

We'd like to incorporate EVERYTHING in Tintin 3 into the server (except for
multiple sessions -- but even multiple sessions would be good for the MS-DOS
single-player version).  People use clients anyways.  Why not make it easy on
them, and give everyone the same advantage.



=== 'Retire' Command

For those 50 level players who keep hanging around!
