=== Greetings!

My name in MUDs is Zen... in rl i'm called Vasco Costa.
The first MUD i ever played was Envy 2.0 and Envy is my favorite mud still.
Reasons? No need of scrolls of recall, no need to retrieve corpse, need i go
on? Envy is soo much user friendly...


=== BUGS/UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES in this release of UltraEnvy:

		Missile weapons support isn't very good yet (no bugs though).
		Ridable mobs need more testing.
		Clans code needs even more testing.
		Resets aren't converted properly.  (ILAB OLC feature).
		  [check out shaolin.are object's levels]

Otherwise, none i know of. I usually squash them when i see them. But see
new.txt also, just in case i forgot to add something here.

Thanx are in order for Joguel, Satan, Spear & Thanatos for helping me playtest
the mud in the early days.  Also thanx to all the players of DragonMud which
flooded me with bugs reports ;-)  I couldn't have made this release stable
without your precious help.


=== BUGS/UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES in Envy 2.2:


Zen:			Don't do "ofind all"... If you do... segmentation fault!
			Since "ofind all" overflowed the output buffer it would
			  crash the mud.
			Fixed!


Zen:			mobile_update() in update.c: mobs flee in terror if hurt
			  from some PC even if they can't see him...
			Fixed!

Zen:			do_imtlset has a bug when you use the '-' option.
			  Sometimes the mud crashes with a segmentation fault...
			Fixed!


Zen:			If you set a mobile in the area files to have
			  AFF_CHARM and try to kill him the mud crashes... :(
			NOW FIXED! The bug was in fight.c's violence_update().


Kenneth Dugas:		lower level thieves steal better than > level bug
Zen:			comment: Steal bug still existed in act_obj.c!!!!!!!! :(
			NOW FIXED! Just changed "percent > number_percent()" to
			  "percent < number percent".


Zen:			Mob of race Fish may walk in dry land...
			Solution: change do_move in act.move.c.
			Fixed!

Joguel:			characters/mobs of race Fish can't breathe
			if room is ROOM_WATER_SWIM or ROOM_WATER_NOSWIM!
Zen:			Solution: fix update.c
			Fixed!


Zen & Joguel: 		Wand of water breathing in Midgaard magic shop is
			  utterly useless unless player is of race Bear.
			As default player races don't have RACE_SWIM players 
			  can't move in ROOM_UNDERWATER (see act_move.c)
			Fish and God race have gills so why bother with the
			  wand? Zen's suggestion: new swim skill.
			Swim skill implemented!


Zen:			'Cast from pointer to integer of different size' 
			  warnings in save.c caused segmentation faults on DEC
			  Alpha.


Zen:			Fixed bug in Envy 2.2 which caused descriptions of
			  objects in player files to have the corrupt string on
			  DEC Alpha.  Some genius defined key_data.key[11]  In
			  case you don't know this has value range [0..10] NOT
			  [0..11] so when comparing "Description" which is
			  actually { 'D', 'e', 's', 'c', 'r', 'i', 'p', 't',
			  'i', 'o', 'n' ,'\0' } you ran out of space...
