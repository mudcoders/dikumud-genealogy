=== Immortal commands

Because Envy treats the immortal commands as skills, immortal characters
can be tailored by the Implementor Director depending on what commands
the Director feels they should have the capability to perform.  Below is
a list of the base level necessary for the use of a given command.  In
order to access a given command, the player must have the command name string
in the Immskll field.
