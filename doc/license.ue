HomeCooked 0.87 is a derivative of EnvyMud, version 2.2, and is subject to 
the copyright and license agreements for both Diku Mud, Merc Diku Mud,
and Envy Mud.

In order to use HomeCooked you must follow the Diku license, the Merc license,
the Envy license and my license.  The exact terms of the Diku license are in the
file 'license.doc'.  A summary of these terms is:

        -- No resale or operation for profit.
        -- Original author's names must appear in login sequence.
        -- The 'credits' command must report original authors.
        -- You must notify the Diku creators that you are operating a Diku mud.

The exact terms of the Merc license are in the file 'license.txt'.  A summary
of these terms is:

        -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
        -- 'Help merc' must report Merc help text, as shipped.

The exact terms of the Envy license are in the file 'license.nvy'.  A summary
of these terms is:

        -- Copyrights must remain in original source.
        -- 'Help envy' must report Envy help text, as shipped.

My terms are:
	-- All my code here is *freeware*.
	-- But the snippets have their own author rights, please give credit
	   where credit is due.
        -- Don't forget to follow the Envy, Merc and Diku licenses. You should
	   find them in the 'doc' directory.

Neither the Merc, EnvyMud nor HomeCooked license terms require keeping author
names in the 'greeting' text.  If you want to include a reference to Merc and
its authors (Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn), EnvyMud and its authors (Kahn and
Hatchet) or HomeCooked author (Zen), they would appreciate it, but do not
require it.  However, you must keep the original Diku authors in the login
sequence.

These are very generous terms for any software.  If you don't want to accept
them, feel free to run some other software, or write your own.


=== DISCLAIMER! ATTENTION!

  I have worked hard on this code and i ask you nothing for it. All i can
say is that it works fine on my 16MB Pentium Linux system and without any
warnings or errors, i have tested the code very throughly and found no
bugs (yet). So i say to you this:
1. If this code blows up your machine it's not my fault.
2. If your girlfriend/boyfriend leaves you it's not my fault.
3. If while crossing the street you are hit by a car it's not my fault.
4. In short: USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
With that said if you report bugs i will *try* to solve them.
