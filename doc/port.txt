=== Platforms

--- UltraEnvy 0.87

These platforms have been directly tested:

	Generic PC	x86		Linux 2.0.29	     -Use Makefile.lnx
        DEC		AXP 10000/620	Digital Unix V4.0B   -Use Makefile.osf
	Sun		Sun4		SunOS 5.5.1	     -Use Makefile.sol
	Generic PC	x86		Windows NT           -See README.WIN


If you have gcc on your system, it would be best to try the standard Makefile
first.  If you have cc on your system, it would be best to try the standard
Makefile with gcc replaced with cc.

The standard version of gcc as of this release is gcc 2.7.2.1

I am simply unable to test UltraEnvy on every platform. It should work on the
same platforms Envy2.2 does, since this code isn't very machine dependent
(i think).


=== Requirements

The hardware requirements are essentially: two megabytes of memory; five
megabytes of disk space; any 32-bit processor; 50 kilobits per second network
bandwidth.  Processor speed is not important.

The software requirements are essentially: a C compiler; a Unix or
Unix-like operating system; BSD-compatible TCP/IP networking.

Envy uses 32-bit integers and is casual about the distinction between 'int' and
'long'.  (It is possible to clean up the code to run with 16-bit integers, but
the demand is nonexistent, and we don't have any 16-bit C compilers with which
to test.)  If you are running on a personal computer, make sure your C compiler
is giving you 32-bit integers and not running in 16-bit mode.

Area files, player files, the note file, class files, the socials file and the
bugs/ideas/typo files are all in ASCII format, so that they may be freely moved
from one machine type to another.


=== Performance

All this measured on a 16MB Pentium 100 MHz running Linux 2.0.29.

Boot time:    5 CPU seconds (Envy2.2: 5 CPU seconds on my system).
Memory:       4984 bytes SZ size.
CPU usage:    1.5 CPU minutes per hour + 1-2 CPU seconds per player.
Disk space:   6 megabytes plus 10K per player file.
IP packets:   about 10 per second with 20 people logged in. (?)
