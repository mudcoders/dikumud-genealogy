1. Welcome to CircleMUD!

1.1.  Background and Introduction

     CircleMUD is a derivative of DikuMUD -- the Multi-User Dungeon
developed at DIKU (the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Copenhagen).  Circle 1.0 ran at Johns Hopkins University with moderate
popularity from January 1992 to September of 1992.  After CircleMUD 2.0 was
publicly released in June of 1993, Circle has been maintained as a public
code base that anyone can use to start a MUD.  The original CircleMUD has
not run since it went down in 1992, nor will it ever run again.

     Hundreds of carefully spent hours have gone into the development of
Circle, but it is not a finished product -- it's only a beginning.  It has
only a small number of spells and skills, a small world with relatively few
areas, and only the 4 original Diku classes.  From a gamer's point of view,
it pales in comparison to other MUDs which have dozens of spells spread over
a dozen classes, a rich palette of skills, and thousands upon thousands
rooms, mobiles, and objects.

     On the other hand, from a programmer's point of view, Circle is very
highly developed.  While the look and feel of the original DikuMUD has been
maintained, most of the underlying code and many of the structures have been
optimized, reworked, or completely redesigned to be efficient, compact, and
easily changeable and extensible.  Dozens of features which have become
standard in the MUDding world over the past few years, although they were
not part of the original Diku release, were added to Circle as well.

     The result is that CircleMUD is a launching pad for your own MUD ideas. 
My hope in releasing it is that it will free potential MUD implementors from
having to worry about dealing with bug-ridden code or wasting time
reinventing the wheel by re-coding standard MUD features, allowing them to
devote more effort towards creatively shaping Circle into their own unique
vision of how a MUD should look and feel.  The reason why Circle has so few
specialized spells, skills, classes, and races is to encourage implementors
just like you to create your own unique system instead of just another stock
MUD that everyone has seen before.

     So, it is with this message that I inflict my code on the world: don't
just put another generic MUD on the Net -- give us something new and
exciting, and have as much fun as possible in the process!


1.2.  Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due

     Before doing anything else, please look at CircleMUD license in the
file license.doc.  

     USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IN ANY CAPACITY IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE READ,
     UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREED TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET
     DOWN BY THE CIRCLEMUD LICENSE.

     The license is simple.  It boils down to the message, "Don't rip off
other people's work."  Unfortunately, this simple message ended up becoming
somewhat long-winded because I was trying to prevent people from abusing
DikuMUD in the future as they have in the past.

     Also, out of courtesy if nothing else, please keep the 'credits' file
intact.  You can add your own credits on top of the existing file, but I'd
appreciate it if you would not simply remove it and all references to the
word "Circle" everywhere in the MUD.



2. Compiling Circle

2.1.  Porting and Compatibility Issues

     Ultrix 4.0 was used as CircleMUD's development platform up through
v2.00.  Starting with 2.10, various versions of Linux were used from 0.99.11
up to 1.1.91.  SunOS 4.1.3 on a Sun Sparcstation was also used for testing
many versions after 2.20.

     For Circle 3.0, a great effort was made to make Circle more portable by
converting all of its system calls over to POSIX compliance.  (POSIX stands
for Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX and is an effort to
standardize the way UNIX programs talk to the operating system.  For more
information, see Stevens' excellent book, "Advanced Programming in the UNIX
Environment.")  Converting Circle to POSIX vastly helps portability on
POSIX- compliant systems; most modern operating systems are POSIX-compliant. 
Unfortunately, on some older systems that are not (such as NextSTEP 2.x), it
may be more difficult to compile 3.0 than it was to compile earlier
versions.

     The most important result of POSIX-standard system calls for MUD
implementors is that Circle is now compatible with SVR4 versions of Unix. 
In fact, Circle 3.0 compiles right out of the box under Solaris 2.3
(although it does require extra libraries at the link stage -- see the next
section on Makefile options for details).  If you have any POSIX-compliant
operating system such as SunOS, Solaris, Linux, or Ultrix, and an ANSI-
compatible C compiler such as gcc, you should be able to compile Circle with
no changes to the source at all.

     CircleMUD 3.0 has been found to be compatible with the following
systems:

<still under construction.  this is beta documentation, remember?>



2.2.  Makefile Options

     Before trying to compile Circle, take a look at the beginning of the
Makefile.  It has a number of options for specific operating systems.  If
you see your operating system listed, activate the appropriate lines as
instructed in the Makefile.

     The Makefile currently has options to compile the MUD under AIX, IRIX,
SVR4 systems such as Solaris.  If your operating system isn't listed, don't
make any changes to the Makefile at all -- just try compiling with the
unmodified Makefile.


2.3.  Compiling the Source

     1) Go into the /src directory
     2) Type 'make all' and cross your fingers.

     The /src directory contains the source code for the main MUD and
/src/utils has the source for a dozen or so MUD maintenance utilities.  The
Makefile itself is in the /src directory.  All compiling should be performed
from the /src directory.  To compile the Circle server alone, simply type
'make'.  Type 'make utils' to compile the administration utilities.  Type
'make all' to compile both the server and the utilities.  You can also
compile an individual utility by typing 'make x', where x is the name of the
utility you want to compile.  Complete documentation of the utility programs
can be found in utils.doc.

     Despite my best efforts there's a chance that you'll have problems
compiling Circle if you're using some version of UNIX that I've never seen
before.  It's impossible to give general advice on how to port software,
except to say that you should ask a friend who knows a lot about both UNIX
and C to help you.  Also, if you have problems, you should definitely look
at the CircleMUD FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions list with Answers), which
you'll find in Circle's home directory.  

     If you do port Circle to some other platform successfully, please share
your hard work with others by sending a description of what you had to do to
get Circle to compile on your system to jelson@jhu.edu.  Be sure to include
the specific name of your operating system and hardware.

     The Makefile directs all compiled programs to the /bin directory. 
Although not necessary, you may want to put Circle's /bin directory in your
$PATH.


3. Running Circle

3.1.  Execution and 'autorun'

     1) type 'autorun &'
     2) Wait a few moments for the server to boot.
     3) type 'telnet localhost 4000'.

     Circle should always be run from circle's "root" directory, not the
/bin directory.  You can run it manually by typing 'bin/circle' (useful for
testing and debugging).  For running the game "for real," it's better to use
the 'autorun' shell script provided in Circle's root directory.

     Autorun lets Circle run itself for long periods of time.  It
continuously runs the game as well as removing old system logs, moving newer
system logs to the /log directory, and saving certain log entries to
permanent files.

     Autorun can be controlled by creating files with certain names.  You
can use the 'touch' command to create a file, and, of course, the 'rm'
command to remove a file.  If a file called '.fastboot' exists, the Circle
will reboot immediately if it crashes or is shut down instead of waiting 40
seconds as it normally does.  A file called '.killscript' will cause the
script to terminate itself; i.e., if you want to bring the game down.  If
you want to temporarily prevent the MUD from rebooting, create a file called
'pause'; the script will go into a wait loop until 'pause' is removed.

     Although you can create these files manually, the SHUTDOWN command from
within the MUD has several options which will create these files for you. 
See the SHUTDOWN help entry in wizhelp.doc for more information.


3.2.  Command-Line Options

     Circle recognizes a number of command-line options.  You can use them
by actually specifying them on the command-line when running Circle
manually; or, by adding them to the FLAGS variable in your autorun script to
use the options automatically every time you run the MUD with autorun.

The syntax is:

circle [-m] [-q] [-r] [-s] [-d <path>] [<port #>]


-m   Mini-Mud Mode.  Mini-mud will be one of your most powerful debugging
     tools; it causes Circle to boot with an abridged world, cutting the
     boot time down to several seconds.  It is useful for testing features
     which are not world-related (i.e, new commands or spells).

     CircleMUD uses split world files (in the lib/world hierarchy); each
     directory (i.e., wld, obj, mob, shp, and zon) has a file called 'index'
     which specifies which files should be loaded at boot-time.  The file
     'index.mini' specifies which parts of the world should be loaded with
     the -m option.

-q   Quick boot.  Prevents checking of timed out object files.  Every time
     Circle boots, it checks every object file to see if it has timed out;
     if so, it is deleted.  This is done primarily to save disk space.  If
     time is more important to you than space, use the -q option.  -q is
     automatically activated when you use -m.

-r   Restricted game.  Allows you to decide at run-time whether or not the
     game will allow new characters to be created.  Using -r is equivalent
     to typing "wizlock 1" (see wizhelp.doc for more information).

-s   Special routines disabled.  Allows you to suppress the assigning and
     calling of all mobile, object, and world special procedures. 
     Historically used as a debugging tool in conjunction with the -d option
     (see below), but now obsolete because Circle checks to make sure
     entities exist before attempting to assign a spec_procs to them.

-d   Data directory.  Useful as a debugging and development tool, if you
     want to keep one or more sets of game data in addition to the standard
     set, and choose which set is to be used at run-time.  For example, you
     may wish to make a copy of the entire world in a separate directory, so
     that you can test additions to the world files without subjecting
     players to unnecessary hazards.  The default data directory is 'lib'. 
     Any core dumps (may they never happen to you!) will take place in the
     selected data directory.

port Port selection.  Allows you to choose on which port the game is to
     listen for connections.  The default port is 4000, which is
     historically the port used by most DikuMUDs.  You can change default in
     config.c and the PORT= line of the autorun script.  (The PORT= line of
     config.c simply passes the value as a command-line parameter to
     circle.)  The port specified on the command line or by the autorun
     script will take precedence over the port specified in config.c.


3.3.  Creating an Implementor Character

     The first character to log in to the MUD will be made the maximum
(Implementor) level.  If you log in and aren't made an implementor, then the
playerfile probably isn't empty -- take the MUD down, delete the playerfile
(lib/etc/players), and start the MUD again.  You should fix your stats using
the RESTORE command when you first create the character (i.e., type "RESTORE
<your-name>".

     Once you're logged in as an implementor, type WIZHELP for a list of
privileged commands.  Documentation of those commands is contained in the
file wizhelp.doc.  wizhelp.doc is in the standard help file format, so you
can simply add it to the help index file if you want online help available
for wizard commands.  (wizhelp.doc is not contained in the online help by
default as a security precaution.)

     To create additional wizard characters, log them in normally as level
1.  Then, advance them using your implementor character, using the ADVANCE
command.  See wizhelp.doc for more information.


4. Configuring Circle

     Once you get over the initial euphoria of having your own MUD compile
and run successfully for the first time, you should be aware of some of the
files which control how Circle looks and feels so that you can configure it
for your personal taste.


4.1.  config.c

     The most useful file for configuration is the config.c source file.  It
has dozens of options useful for customizing your MUD.  Before you open your
MUD to players, you should read through config.c from beginning to end,
checking what options are available as well as making sure they're all set
the way you want them.  Remember, you have to recompile and rerun the MUD
before any changes you make to config.c take effect, of course.


4.2.  Text Files

     The place where most of your day-to-day changes will be is in the
lib/text directory, which contains all of the text files read by players. 
The most visible file is "motd", (Message Of The Day), which is the message
that mortals seen (though not necessarily read!) when they log in. 
Similarly, the "imotd" (Immortal MOTD) is seen by immortals when they log
in.  Other interesting files are "news" (for the NEWS command), "help" (for
the HELP command), "help_table" (for HELP <x>), and others.

     One file is particularly important: "policy".  Despite what anyone
tells you and your best efforts to the contrary, your MUD will have
political problems.  If anyone tells you that you can run a MUD without
politics, they're wrong.  If you tell your players that you're going to run
a revolutionary MUD that doesn't have any politics, you're lying.  Every MUD
has political problems sooner or later (usually sooner).  There are various
ways to make political problems easier to handle, but the best way is to
decide on some ground rules from the very beginning, and then set those
decisions down in writing.  That's what the "policy" file is for.  You
probably know what kind of political problems MUDs have (you're not trying
to run a MUD without ever having played one, are you!?) -- stuff like
playerkilling, thieving, kill stealing, client use, multi-char playing,
reimbursements, etc.  Decide on your policies early and make sure your
characters know what those policies are.

     It's also important to set down in writing rules for what immortals are
allowed to do and not allowed to do.  That's what the "handbook" (Immortal
Handbook) is for.  Immortals will always try to bend you as far as they can,
so it's important for you to decide on answers to questions before those
questions come up.  Can immortals assist players?  What about giving a
single 'cure light' for a player about to die?  Can immortals kill mobiles
for their own enjoyment?  Can they kill players for the same reason?  Are
they allowed to make policy?  Break policy?  Moderate disputes?  Turn over
each others' decisions?


4.3.  World Files

     The root of the area hierarchy is lib/world.  lib/world has 5
subdirectories: wld, mob, obj, shp, and zon, which is where the world,
mobile, object, shop, and zone files go, respectively.  Each directory has
a set of world files in it with the appropriate extension (i.e., the obj
subdir will have a bunch of files ending with ".obj", such as 30.obj,
31.obj, etc.) plus two special files called "index" and "index.mini". 
"index" is a list of which world files are to be loaded by Circle.  This
makes the job of adding new areas easier -- just add the new area files to
your area directory, and then add the name of the new file to "index". 
"index.mini" controls which (smaller) set of world files should be loaded in
the debugging mode (Mini-Mud Mode, explained below.)


5. System Logs

     CircleMUD writes a wide variety of information to standard output and
standard error.  If you're using the autorun script, the boot messages are
put into a file called "syslog".  During Circle's boot sequence, the system
log keeps a record of everything the MUD is doing to initialize itself; this
can be useful to determine what the problem is if the MUD dies while it is
booting.  Once the game is up and running, the syslog contains player
information, recording when players connect, disconnect, rent, unrent, quit,
die, hit death traps, etc.  The game also records status information about
itself, falling generally into two categories: usage information and errors.


5.1.  Player Information

     The player information recorded by Circle's system logs will serve you
very well as your players start to make wild claims about strange bugs
resulting in them losing equipment or points.  Many mudders prey on the
insecurities of a new mud administrator who is terrified that his or her MUD
is riddled with bugs and will do anything to satisfy grumpy players -- don't
let yourself fall into that trap!  CircleMUD is bound to contain bugs, but
most of the core systems have been well tested, so you should take claims
such as "I magically lost all my stuff!" with a grain of salt and check your
system logs.

     If a player ever asks you for reimbursement of equipment, money, gold,
experience points (XP), or whatever, your gut reaction should always be to
check the logs first.

     As a sidebar, let me point out that the value of system logs is 
     twofold: 1) they actually provide you with valuable information,
     and 2) they make your players paranoid.  When I first started
     mudding and I heard about this mysterious "system log", it made me
     incredibly paranoid.  Now that I've done a good deal of MUD
     administration, I've seen the same paranoia in _many_ other
     players.

     That paranoia is a very good thing.  The system logs become an
     abstract and shapeless but omnipresent force on the MUD.  Players
     hear about "the System Log" and then get paranoid that everything
     they do is being recorded, so they tend to behave, lest the evil
     System Log betray their wrongdoings to the Gods.

     For this reason, when you go to check your logs, it's a good idea
     to say something like "Hold on -- let me go check the system logs,
     OK?" because it reinforces the syslog's presence in the collective
     psyche of your players.

     Back to the point.  When someone claims that they've been wronged by
the evil system, always check the logs.  The logs give you power to say
things like "What do you mean your items disappeared in rent -- it says
right here in the logs 'Rasmussen has quit the game.' -- you didn't rent at
all, you just QUIT!"

     To diffuse disputes such as, "The game dumped my stuff, but I had
enough money!!", two types of log entries are written.  First, every time a
character rents, the log records the character's per diem rent rate as well
as the total amount of money on hand and in the bank.  Second, the log
records makes a record of all characters' equipment dumped due to
insufficient funds.  

     Remember, rent is specified as a daily rate but is amortized on a per-
second basis!  In other words, if you rent at the rate of 100 coins per day
and come back 36 hours later, you'll be charged 150 coins.

     The autorun script saves 6 levels of raw system logs.  In addition, it
greps the logs for certain pieces of extra-juicy information to save
indefinitely.

     The system logs are your friends.  Love them.


5.2.  Usage Information

     Every 5 minutes, the game counts how many people are playing and
records that information in the system log.  Optionally, if you #define
RUSAGE in comm.c, it will also record system resource information such as
CPU time and memory used.  The usage information currently logged by Circle
is, as you can see, somewhat sparse; local MUD admins are encouraged to add
to this code as is appropriate for their particular site.

     Usage information isn't critical, but it is interesting to look at the
usage patterns to determine when your peak playing hours are.  If you're
good at using 'cut' and other Unix utilities, you can even dazzle your
friends by graphing your MUD's system usage.

     [ Note: friends not included with the CircleMUD distribution. ]


5.3.  Errors

     Just as your first gut instinct should be to look at the logs if a
player starts begging you for something, your first gut instinct in the
event of a crash or unexpected shutdown should also be to look at the system
logs.

     A Unix utility called 'tail' is used to look at the last few lines of
a text file; it's very useful for looking at the last entries in the system
log to see the last thing that happened before the shutdown.  Often, Circle
will report an error in the logs just before it crashes.  This method is
particularly useful if the MUD crashes during its boot sequence, because the
logging during boot is intensive.

     If Circle shuts down unexpectedly and there is no core dump in the /lib
directory, the game probably detected an internal error and killed itself.
Such shutdowns are always preceded by entries in the system log describing
the error.

     If there's no error message at the end of the log, then there probably 
IS a core dump, so you can use 'dbx', 'gdb', etc. to examine the core dump
and determine the reason for the crash.  The file 'hacker.doc', generously
provided by Furey of MERC Industries, offers useful insight into the art and
science of debugging -- you'd be well advised to give it a look-see.

     Circle sometimes encounters a serious but non-fatal error; in this
case, the error will be written to the system log with the prefix SYSERR,
but the MUD will not shut itself down.  You should always be aware of any
SYSERRs which occur -- they are often useful for foreseeing imminent danger
or averting problems before they become critical.  If a SYSERR does occur,
try to determine if a change you've made recently has caused it.  Ignoring
SYSERRs is like ignoring compiler warnings: you can be tempted to ignore
them because the game keeps going even if they exist, but you can easily get
yourself into trouble by not listening.  The autorun script saves all
SYSERRs to the file log/errors.


6. MUD Maintenance

6.1.  Technical Maintenance

     Once you get the MUD up and running, you'll surely want to modify it --
adding new areas, new features, new code, and new ideas!  But, those topics
are beyond the scope of this document.  See coding.doc, areas.doc, and other
creation documents for more information about how to customize your MUD once
you get it up and running.  This section simply focuses on some of the
simple maintenance that'll be necessary to keep your MUD running smoothly. 
Make sure not to get so caught up in being a God that you forgot you're also
supposed to be acting as a software engineer!

     First, you should look at the log/errors file regularly to make sure
there are no recurring problems, particularly problems that may have been
caused by code you've added.  If the MUD crashes, it will usually generate
what's called a "core dump" -- a big file called "core" in your lib
directory, created by the operating system to record the state the game was
in the moment before it crashed.  You should look at the core dump using a
debugger such as "gdb" or "dbx" to determine why the MUD crashed.  See the
file "hacker.doc" for more information about debugging.

     You probably will want to clean out the playerfile on a regular basis
to remove deadweight characters (i.e., people who log in and look around for
10 minutes, and then never come back).  You can decide how often to purge
the playerfile -- every day if disk space is tight, or every month if it
isn't.  The purgeplay utility program included in the src/util directory
removes deadweight players.  Make sure to run the "purgeobjs" script (in the
lib/plrobjs directory) after you purge the playerfile.  purgeobjs removes
the object files of players who no longer exist in the playerfile.

     The 'automaint' script in the main circle directory will automatically
purge the playerfile and player objects for you.  DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT
WHILE THE MUD IS RUNNING!  Doing so will make your life (more) difficult.


6.2.  Diplomatic Maintenance

     Okay, so now you have your wonderful CircleMUD up and running smoothly
and all is right with the world.  Right?

     Wrong.

     Well, technically, right.  Circle requires very little day-to-day
attention in order to keep the program itself running smoothly.  But the MUD
itself is just a series of instructions running on a computer, processing
data.  Never lose sight of the fact that there will be dozens, hundreds, or
maybe even thousands of people connecting to your MUD -- and they are not
programs.  They're people!

      From the technical side, there are relatively few things you have to
do to keep the game running.  But you can't just dump a MUD on the Internet
and then ignore it!  Spend time on your MUD.  Try to keep up with the
boards, and make an effort to respond to the complaints, ideas, and
suggestions posted there.  Take a look at the 'bug', 'typo', and 'idea'
files from time to time -- and maybe even respond to some of the ideas using
Mudmail.  Try to respond to Mudmail you receive from players in a timely
manner.  Make sure that your 'news', 'policy' and other text files are
up-to-date and suit the political climate on your MUD.

     If you can't or just don't want to deal with the player politics, make
sure that you choose someone who can and will, and make them responsible for
dealing with it.  If no one does it, your MUD will stagnate and die.


7. A Final Thought

     Try to remember that running a MUD should be fun.  It can sometimes be
easy to lose sight of the ultimate goal of personal enjoyment that MUDs are
supposed to provide, particularly when MUDs start to get crushed under the
weight of their own politics or the egos of the administrators.  If you find
that your MUD is more of a source of frustration than enjoyment, don't be
afraid to close it.

     Good luck with your MUD!  And, always feel free to write me and let me
know what you think of the MUD, and the interesting things you've done with
it.  I can't promise a timely response, but I love hearing from people who
are using my code.
