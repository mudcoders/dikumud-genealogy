=== What's new in Envy 2.2

Many of the changes from Envy 2.0 release to Envy 2.2 were done by the
reduced (from Envy 2.0) coding staff of EnvyMud.  A few were obtained
from the merc mailing list and private contributions.  See
'contrib.txt' for acknowledgements.

We have kept logs of what we have done here in EnvyMud.  It helps in
backtracking what was done to the code.  It also helps others follow your
steps should you release your code like us.  :)  You might want to do the
same.


=== Envy 2.2 notes

There has been an email thread on online reboots which will maintain
player links until the next mud comes up.  I believe this feature is
not particularly necessary.  If you wish to code this feature, you
should contact:  Melvin Smith <msmith@quix.robins.af.mil>,
quest@newl.com, tadriaen@zorro.ruca.ua.ac.be, and/or erwin@pip.dknet.dk.

Online editing has not been a feature which I have spent any time on.
As far as I can remember, there is an OLC port for Envy 2.0 and ILAB
for Envy 1.0.  I forget where you can receive such a package.  I
suggest you contact merc-l@webnexus.com.
