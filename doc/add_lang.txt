	Think of a new language...

	Define the language in merc.h under the section 'language stuff'
	and give it a new language number.
	Increase MAX_LANGUAGE by 1
	add a DECLARE_DO_FUN in merc.h along with the others...

	In const.c update the lang_table, add your language at the bottom

	In language.c add a function that calls do_language, call it
	do_<some language here>			(just like the others)

	Add a command in interp.c (after the other languages)
