=== ILAB OLC Beta 1.1 for Envy 2.0 muds

This is Jason Dinkel's ILAB OLC Beta 1.1 package re-released for Envy 2.0
muds.  It was derived from the package originally released for Envy 1.0.
Changes were made to accommodate new features in Envy 2.0.  By no means
do I guarantee this to be stable, or work 100% of the time.  If you
find something that doesn't work, please report it to the Merc-L mailing
list (merc-l@webnexus.com) or email me directly at stoked@iastate.edu

This is an updated version of one I released last month, with bug fixes.


=== What is ILAB OLC?

ILAB OLC = "I Love Amy Barr" On-Line Creation.

ILAB OLC is a constantly revised online creation system distributed by
Jason Dinkel.  It was based on the public domain version of OLC written
by Surreality and distributed by Locke in The Isles 1.1.  The first
release was in December of 1994.  Since then many changes have occurred
that make it a much better system to use for your online creation needs.


=== Notes for Envy2.2 (by Zen)

Now MobPrograms have been fairly tested but OLC hasn't. So please have
patience and solve the bugs you find ;-)
The mud should run 1st time.  It has been tested on a Linux 2.0.29 system and
gives no compiling warnings or such.  Check out the files in newdocs/OLC11
for OLC.
The code was severely mutilated by myself :) so you should have trouble
recognizing olc.c & olc_act.c from the previous versions since i made a
u-turn and now the code resembles more its The Isles origins.  Purists shall
become shocked to know i purged the code of loads of small functions for
a few monster 20+ page functions; however i find the code easier to read!
This code may be rewritten again, i'm still not happy with it.
