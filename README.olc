ILAB OLC Beta 1.1

=== ILAB OLC Beta 1.1 for Envy 2.0 muds

This is Jason Dinkel's ILAB OLC Beta 1.1 package re-released for Envy 2.0
muds.  It was derived from the package originally released for Envy 1.0.
Changes were made to accomodate new features in Envy 2.0.  By no means
do I guarantee this to be stable, or work 100% of the time.  If you
find something that doesn't work, please report it to the Merc-L mailing
list (merc-l@webnexus.com) or email me directly at stoked@iastate.edu

So far I am only including two things: the patched Envy 2.0 source with
OLC built in, and an olcenvy20.diff patch file.  If I have the time I
may re-create the snippet, as the original 1.0 is in the changes/ subdirectory.

This is an updated version of one I released last month, with bug fixes.
Please read the credits.txt file in the Envy20 subdirectory, and changes.txt
to see exactly what I have changed.


=== What is ILAB OLC?

ILAB OLC = "I Love Amy Barr" On-Line Creation.

ILAB OLC is a constantly revised online creation system distributed by
Jason Dinkel.  It was based on the public domain version of OLC written
by Surreality and distributed by Locke in The Isles 1.1.  The first
release was in December of 1994.  Since then many changes have occured
that make it a much better system to use for you online creation needs.

=== Notes for Envy2.2 (by Zen)

I just ported OLC to Envy2.2. I already had ported MobPrograms to Envy2.2 and
i have them working on my system right now. They seem to be stable and i
took out one bug 2 days ago. Now i tested the system for 4 hours and it
didn't go down... The load was low but it didn't crash or slow down...
I noticed the boot-up time seemed to take a bit longer though.
Now MobPrograms have been fairly tested but OLC hasn't. So please have
patiente and solve the bugs you find ;-) When and if i get a stable
MobPrograms/OLC release, fairly tested i will bring it out to all of you.
The mud should run 1st time. Just needs to compile the executable. It has
been tested on a Linux 2.0.29 system and gives no compiling warnings or
such. Check out the files in src/Contributions/OLC11 for OLC. I also took
the liberty to add 'brew.c' from ftp.game.org which is quite nifty!
