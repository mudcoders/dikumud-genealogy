Krotz is a burly dwarven man. His beard reaches to his mid-belly and his
eyes reflect the fires of the forge. Beneath his eyes are dark rings which

to his long hours at the anvil.

thin waist. Her eyes as deep as the deepest, darkest earth; framed with long and thick lashes. She is built thin but not brittle, and voluptuous where it counts.
Heart-shaped lips part slightly with a grin, making her more deceiving than 
you'd hope to think.

Nartika is a small woman, hence her pixie heritage... she has long blonde
hair (which is tucked neatly behind her pointed ears), and slanty blue eyes
with possibly the longest eyelashes you have ever seen. She is a thin girl,
perhaps too thin, as her collar bone protrudes from her chest noticeably. But
this aside she is an attractive young girl, seemingly about early twenties in
age. Sheer wings peer out from behind her when she turns her back to you, and
they sparkle with silver lining as the light reflects from them.

Schmendrick~
A young man notices that you have entered.

Schmendrick is a young man who looks to be in his late 20's. He is very tall,
standing at almost 6 feet in height but has no braun to speak of... you would
guess that he weighs in around 150 pounds at the most. He is quite handsome
though and you can sense a friendly aura about him.

Mommy is a short old woman, standing at just over 4 feet tall. Her back is
slightly hunched over, and because of this she must walk with a cane. She is
not a thin woman, although would not be considered fat either. Let's just say
that the law of gravity has distributed her weight in all the wrong places. A
round face framed with straw-like white hair would be friendly to look at if it
weren't for her lazy left eye and the many wrinkles that show her age of many
many years.

A beautiful Unicorn, white as the purest snow.

A Unicorn is the most breathtaking creature in all the land... and the most
good. Although the rare beast may look like a well-bred mare, it is not in
the least comparable. A white body, white as the purest snow and a cornsilk 
mane and tail... split hooves on all four, and a cornsilk beard at its chin...
The Unicorn's horn spirals up to the heavens from its forehead with a blue 
glow, and its innocence beguiles even the vilest of evil.

have straggles out under the little cap on his head. A round face and large

A Path of Rose Bushes~
The familiar path of rose bushes make your path going north and south of here.

A Path of Rose Bushes~
The path of rose bushes takes you to the east and to the south, and you can
still hear the rustling of the leaves as they grow rapidly before your eyes.
Wildflowers have been allowed to grow here on the west and north end of the
path. And despite the rose bushes that keep them within the grounds of the
garden, they seem to be smiling back at you.

Rose bushes line the path that leads to the north, west and south directions.
Happy wildflowers line the path at your feet, and they seem to be smiling back
at you despite the roses that hold them within the grounds of the garden. Tall
sunflowers look down on you from above and they stand guard from here in all    directions for as far as you can see to the north and south.

Weeping Fig Lane~
This pathway is again surrounded in the familiar rose bushes that grow to
make your path, and to keep you inside the grounds of the garden. However,
little trees also line your path here, they're trunks rise up to about five
feet and weeping branches droop out from the tops. Each trunk of each weeping
fig has been braided at youth, and thus they all have a different trunk 
pattern. The path takes you to the north and to the south.

someone's laundry off of a string tied to different ends of the roses. You
are at someone's front door! You can hear a faint tune being sung.

has been placed in the north east corner of the room. A few ceramic bowls and
untensils lie about the place, some in neat piles and some scattered about
the place in a mess. A small water hole has been dug out in the south east
corner of the hut, and the place smells of a sweetness you cannot place.

you and you can still catch up to them... maybe they know of a way out! But
they could also be an enemy waiting for you to follow them to your doom. The
only thing to do is continue in the direction you are headed to find out. The
rose bushes grow rapidly here, the weeping figs sway in the breeze, and the
wildflowers smile back at you as you go by.

Nartika's Necessaries~
This little closet of a shop is made from a large toadstool, and every
piece of furniture inside is part of the toadstool that hasn't been carved
away. There is a little counter at the north end of the place, and a few
little shelves on each of the east and west walls. The smell of cinnamon
lingers on here very strongly, perhaps too strongly for your liking. If you
are larger than four and a half feet you have to crouch or squeeze your
front end in through the door to catch a peek. A little window carved out
in the south east wall allows the natural light to shine in.

A Dead End~
Your path comes to an end here. The rose bushes surround the area keeping guard
of what comes in and what goes out. Thorns poke out from every angle in the
bushes threatening you to stay back... and the familiar rustling of the leaves
lingers on. Your only exit is east.

Floating...~
You float upward, not knowing where you are going or what will be at the
end of your journey... if there is an end. However, regardless of your
situation, you feel safe somehow. The darkness lingers on around you, but
the stars are no longer there... an illusion perhaps?  Could this be a
dream?

Floating...~
You float upward wondering what will be at the end of this path. Ahhh... the

oh so much more. Your path is what takes you to your destiny, to the person
you are to become...

friends from the past... treasures gained, treasures lost, humiliation and 
victory. At this, you feel yourself being pulled to your destiny...

Room of Warding~
This large room is bare, save the spiral staircase going up in the north
east wall. Different symbols have been drawn on all four walls, perhaps
runes of warding to discourage trespassers. Maybe there is a way out of
here. After all, why have runes of warding if there is no where to run?

The Mage's Study~
A small staircase leads up to another level in the tower. The ceiling is
low here and the place is scattered with parchments written in a language
you cannot begin to decipher. Everywhere you turn you can see all different
sizes of glass bottles and flasks filled with odd-coloured liquids. A large
black couldron sits over a hearth along the east wall, and from the ceiling
above there are different animal carcasses hanging from a thin piece of
rope. It is quite dismal in here, because the only lighting is severeal
large candles floating about the room.

A large soft bed is set in the north end of the room, underneath a keyhole
window cut out in the stone wall. Beside it lay several blankets, assumingly forthe beast you encountered in the The Mage's Study. Several dressers and a couple
nightables line the east and south wall. Various items rest on each table, 
such as make-up, a hairbrush, mirrors of all sizes and odd things like dried
bats wings, incense, different herbs and other such oddities. A bit of light
shines in from the little window casting shadows here and there.

brighten up the dreariness of your surroundings. The trees around you are gnarly
and twisted, not a sign of green vegetation about. What you are able to see
in the shadows of the available light are trees with menacing faces, and they

An unused part of the path~
The path seems to end here because of the overgrown trees... although looking
carefully to the north you can see that it did continue that way at one point
in time. The ground here is dry and the leftovers of various paw prints have 
been marked in the dirt by the passage of rabbits, deer and some undecipherable
others. This leaves you only to assume that there is a way through. The only
Obvious exit is south.

Giant trees hang over head, leafless and dark. The light that shines in from the
holes in the canopy above you is dim, and the shadows play tricks on you. Faces
in the trees seem to be glaring back at you menacingly, and branches reach
out with their gnarly claws and catch onto your clothing and armour as you pass
by. The path leads off to the north, east, and west of here.
