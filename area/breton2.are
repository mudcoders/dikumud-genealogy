You have entered the armoury.  A forge rests in the northeast corner of the
room, while a thick counter stretches the entire west and north walls.  An
archway exits this room to the south.  The counter is very marked up, it seems
this store does a lot of business.

Forest Path~
You are moving through a very dense forest.  The path seems to get somewhat
clearer and easier to the west.  The trees tower over your head, making you
feel small and insignificant in nature's eyes.

overhead.  A fork can be seen to the east.  You can feel twigs snapping
beneath your feet if you walk, a welcome sound.

Forest Path~
You are moving along a forest path.  A smaller path leads off to the north.
The trees there seem to be growing healthier than the rest of the forest,
perhaps you had better investigate why.

Forest Path~
You are moving along a heavily forested path.  The smell of trees and other
things in nature overwhelms your senses for a moment, as you take a deep
breath.  This scene is almost picturesque, everything is exactly how it
should be.  It is almost eery in a calm sort of way.
