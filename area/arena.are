Name        Entrance to the Steel Cage~
Descr
You stand at the entrance of the Steel Cage of the Arena Circus Maximus... You
notice the skulls of several beings stuck on the top of spear ends. There is
some person's skin here waving at the wind. This terrible sight makes you
release your last meal in the floor. You realize that if you don't succeed the
very same thing shall happen to you. You take a deep breath and prepare to do
battle with your foe in the steel cage. May the best one win. And may the best
one be you of course. Good look adventurer the kill free zone is north.

You are standing on a stone path.  You notice this path as been placed
here a short time ago as the stones are still pearly white.  As you admire
the wildlife of the small woods surrounding you everywhere you realize there
is a gaping whole headed west of here...  You wonder what lurks inside?  A
small sign is here.

Due to popular demand, after the mayor closed down the games boots in the
circus we established a new casino to the north.  Come and play!  There are
big money prizes to be won!

Name        On a stone path~

You are standing on a stone path. You wonder where this path may lead you as
you can't see what could possibly be the reason to put such a marvelous white
marble path on a deserted wood. You guess the circus owner is too rich for his
own good and also completely nuts!
