Entrance to the Steel Cage~
You stand at the entrance of the Steel Cage of the Arena Circus Maximus... You
notice the skulls of several beings stuck on the top of spear ends. There is
some person's skin here waving at the wind. This terrible sight makes you
release your last meal in the floor. You realize that if you don't succeed the
very same thing shall happen to you. You take a deep breath and prepare to do
battle with your foe in the steel cage. May the best one win. And may the best
one be you of course. Good look adventurer the kill free zone is north.

In a dark damp room.~
You are in a dark damp room. The air is moldy and it's hard to breathe here.
You start to feel sick. Better get out of here fast! The walls pulsate as if
the entire room is alive. You fear for your life, just one of these monsters
is enough to send you back to hell!

In a dark room.~
Still in a dark room of the catacombs of doom you notice the air is getting
worser and worser all the time... If it keeps his way you'll be dead in no
time. I hope you are not alone but in a party, it is nicer to die together with
other people surrounding you isn't it? *grin*

You STILL are in a dark room. Its is starting to get boring and the air isn't
getting any better you know. But wait... You sense something north.
You notice there is a room to the east!

In a moldy room.~
Sheesh... These rooms are filthy. You wonder when the cleaning lady came here 
last time? 1000 years ago? Naaaa... it's too messy to be so little time.
In this room the vampire Lord Brominol and his servant plot to end all
humanity. They have gone all the way here to find a powerful allier to fulfill
their evil deeds. You wonder who can be such a powerful being.

In a moat.~
You are in a moat! Ho-ho... it seems you aren't alone in here... You'd better 
watch it. You wish you'd have learned how to swim. You have water up to your
neck, and something is pulling you down bellow, you shout for help but no one
can help you now. You can only rely on yourself to leave this place.
YOU SENSED SOMETHING MOVING!

Steel Cage Arena~
You stand inside the steel cage arena. As you look upwards you notice the
enormous size of it. It is made of several tons of elven steel and reflects
the light which comes from a hole in the ceiling of the cavern's floor.
They must have taken years to build such an awesome cage inside this hidden
site. In front of you there is a sign it says:
This room is an Arena so you are free to KILL ANYONE!

The Path to the Arena~
You are standing in the path to the Steel Cage Arena. North of here you see
the big Cage itself dwarving everything in sight. Circus Maximus includes
hungry lions, gladiators, werewolves and assorted freaks all in this
underground cavern. Some big cavern huh? There is a red carpet in the floor
covering the path to the steel cage. To the east you notice some gladiators
training and to the west you see the lions and beasts area.

The sales booth~
Right here you can see a huge boot where they sell tickets and foodstuffs.
The line ends here. You see a gate to the north leading to the arena. It is
being guarded by two fearsome gladiators. Their armors shine and you feel
terrified by their presence.

The line to the Arena~
What the...? You thought this was an unexplored cavern but you realize that
here is a huge line of people complaining about not having tickets...  What is
happening here? What are all these people up to? You hear one of them claiming
that her cousin who lives in Midgaard told her about this place the Arena
"Circus Maximus" here persons duel each other to the death. It seems this was
disapproved by the Mayor and they had to move here. She has gone all the way
from Solace just to see the show.

The hungry beasts and freaks tent~
The Lions and beasts area. Here you see a Lion and a Werewolf tied strongly to
a chain. The animal keeper seems to hold them strongly enough for you to be
safe. Hold on a minute... He doesn't have his left arm... What gives?
The animals growl as they sense your presence...

The gladiators training room~
You are inside the gladiators training room. Here the gladiator are rushing to
prepare for battle. Amidst the noise of clanging shields and swords they
train so one of them can become the great champion and win the gold coins
prize. As they realize you entered the room they tell you to get out as this
is no place for children.

On the underground cavern~
You are standing at the entrance of an underground cavern. It is dark here and
the air is humid and moldy. In fact it's so moldy you start feeling sick...
Better hurry up and go forward, you did want to explore the cavern didn't you?

On a stone path~
You are standing on a stone path.  You notice this path as been placed
here a short time ago as the stones are still pearly white.  As you admire
the wildlife of the small woods surrounding you everywhere you realize there
is a gaping whole headed west of here...  You wonder what lurks inside?  A
small sign is here.

On a stone path~
You are standing on a stone path. You wonder where this path may lead you as
you can't see what could possibly be the reason to put such a marvelous white
marble path on a deserted wood. You guess the circus owner is too rich for his
own good and also completely nuts!
