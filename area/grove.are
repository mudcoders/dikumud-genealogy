patterns of the clouds as they gently drift across the sky.

along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of Norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-

Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, 
while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) 
fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great 
beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest 
portrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.
