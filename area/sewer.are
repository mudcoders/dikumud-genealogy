This one seems interesting, a big difference from all the other junctions.
It seems cleaner than the rest of them. Weird. Something that looks like 
an air shaft leads upwards, but it looks far too slippery to climb.
The pipes lead to the south, west and north.

Descr
You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there's quite a drop
down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness, 
mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer actually
washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops, 
like a waterfall, into the pool far down.
