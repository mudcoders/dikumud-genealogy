sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long, and straight as an arrow, with
lightly fluted sides. Both edges keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp. Perfection like this could of only been forged by a god. The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade
                      Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

Cookies, twinkies, steak, prime rib, almost anything you can think of, call
out to you. You suddenly feel VERY hungry.

have been spray painted on the walls and floor. Nailed to the ceiling are
an assortement of skeletons. All seem to have been dead for a very long
time. All surfaces of the room are covered with dried blood and dust.

Hall of Fire~
You are standing in a hallway made of fire. The walls are ablaze with
yellow and blue flames. The smell of the hot air and sulfur burn your
lungs as you inhale, and dry your mouth as you exhale. The stone floor
burns at your feet and hungrily drinks up every drop of sweat as they
fall from your body.
The hall of fire continues to the north.

Wall of Fire~
This large room is cut in into sections by small walls of fire. The walls
to move slowly changing the layout of the room. As you examine the room
further you notice various posts around the room to which people are
chained to. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Thier deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...
To the north you see a hall of fire.
To the east you see a lake of fire.
