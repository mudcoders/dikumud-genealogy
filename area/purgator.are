This place looks different from the rest of the area.  Somehow, you have the
feeling that you're near the end of your search. Better not waste anymore 
time coz' you're still cold, hungry and very naked ....but most importantly, 
your corpse is rotting!

This is where you'll face your final judgement.  Your fate will depend on 
your past karma. Silently, you cursed yourself for being such a jerk when
you were alive.  Overwhelmed by anxiety and tears flowing, you beg for mercy
and search desperately for your corpse.  Good Luck!
