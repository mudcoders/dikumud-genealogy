************************* This is the MOTD **************************
~

50 IMOTD~
~

-1 SCHOOL~
Mud School was designed by Hatchet of MERC Industries for any MERC mud.

The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the
game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.
~

-1 ! !! 'EVENT DESIGNATORS'~
   {o{wEvent Designators{x
       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry
       in the history list.

       {o{w!{x      Start  a history substitution.
       {o{w!!{x     Refer to the previous command.  This is  a  synonym
              for `!-1'.
       {o{w!{yn{x     Refer to command line {o{yn{x.
       {o{w!-{yn{x    Refer to the current command line minus {o{yn{x.
       {o{w!{ystring{x
              Refer  to  the  most  recent  command starting with
              {o{ystring{x.
       {o{w!?{ystring{x
              Refer to the most recent command containing {o{ystring{x.

       History is written by Zen (vasc@camoes.rnl.ist.utl.pt)
~

0 HISTORY~
Syntax: history

Use this command to see the history list.

See also: {o{wEVENT DESIGNATORS{x
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <number> <object> <shopkeeper>
Syntax: list  <object | all>    <shopkeeper>
Syntax: sell  <object>          <shopkeeper>
Syntax: value <object>          <shopkeeper>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.  If no quantity is given, the
default is 1.  If no shopkeeper is identified, the first shop keeper
is selected.

LIST with no argument and LIST ALL lists the objects the first shop keeper
will sell you.
LIST <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the first
shop keeper will sell you.
LIST <object | all> <shopkeeper> will do above but from the specific
shopkeeper you defined.

SELL sells an object to the first shop keeper if no shopkeeper is identified.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

BUY, SELL, and VALUE, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if LIST DAGGER showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~

0 WAIT 'WAIT STATES'~
Wait states is a mechanism in which we count the delay between your actions.
Commands such like casting, kicking, walking, disarming, brandishing, zapping,
quaffing, etc cause a certain delay before your next action can go through.
This represents the amount of time you need in order to complete the action.

You may also accumulate a delay when a certain action is performed upon you.
These actions are being tripped, disarmed, etc.

If you are in combat, it is wise to use your wait state level as an indicator
as to when your next command will go through.  Should you have a wait state
greater than 0, all your other typed commands will be queued until your wait
returns to 0.

See: PROMPT
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells, MAGIC, and also please read
the MANA help.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set, you
will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.
~

0 DONATE~
Syntax: donate all.<object>
Syntax: donate     <object>

DONATE allows you to donate to the donation pit whereever it may be.
Immortals have allowed you special communication to a speed daemon who will
place your donated object into the pit.  This deamon, however, will
not transfer items like keys, food, or trash to the pit.  These will
simply disappear.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt 
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your visible inventory.
~

0 FEE~
Syntax: FEE

FEE is a command trap to prevent you from mistakenly typing FEED onto a
PC.

If you wish to FEED on something type FEED in whole.
~

0 FEED~
Syntax: feed
Syntax: feed <victim>

FEED will cause you to lunge at your victims throat.  This is useful for
VAMPIRES for this is the only way they may get food or drink.

With no argument, you will automatically feed on the one you are fighting.
~

0 STAKE~
Syntax: stake <victim>

STAKE will cause you to lunge at your victim with intent to pierce his heart.
You must be wielding a stake as your primary weapon.

Like BACKSTAB, you begin a fight hopefully hitting your mark.
If you miss, more than likely your victim will want to retaliate.

In order to STAKE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 BACKSTAB BS CIRCLE DISARM KICK KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: circle
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
PKILLing.  See PKILL for rules and restrictions.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

A skilled thief can CIRCLE behind an opponent and stab them in the back,
but only if the opponent is sufficiently distracted during a battle
and the thief is free from fending away attacks.

In order to BACKSTAB, CIRCLE, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

~

0 REGISTER~
Syntax: register

If you are at the right place in Midgaard, you may register to become a
PKILLer in the world.

You must be higher than 15th level with the appropriate money.
~


0 BERSERK~
Syntax: berserk

If a warrior successfully goes BERSERK, he or she will wade into the
fray, hacking and slashing with a total disregard for personal safety.
As a result, he or she will hit harder and more often, but will also be
an easier target.  In addition, the player will be unable to flee the
battle or rescue another player until the madness clears.  It's a fight
to the death!
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake  <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 AFK~
Syntax: afk

This command notifies those on the mud that you are definitely away from your
keyboard.  It toggles on if not on or off if on.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

REMOVE as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had two bracers and you wanted to remove the second
one, you would type "remove 2.bracer".  Or if you wanted to remove all your
equipment you would type "remove all".
~

0 'ARMOR WEAR' 'BASIC ARMOR'~
Syntax:    wear <object>
	 remove <object>

ARMOR
  Armor is generally everything that will give you protection when you wear,
  or hold it.  Protection is measured in armor class (AC), then lower the armor
  class the better, i.e. -5 AC is better protection than +5 AC.

BASIC ARMOR
  The amount of protection, the BASIC ARMOR value, depends on the type of
  armor and the quality of the armor in question.  The type of armor is
  determined by the wear location; the quality of non-magical armor varies,
  but you an be sure that magical armor is of the highest quality available.

Sometimes armors have other minor protections, magically bestowed on them,
which will be comparable to just a fraction of BASIC ARMOR.

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

    miss        wound           MUTILATE        DEMOLISH
    scratch     maul            DISEMBOWEL      ANNIHILATE
    graze       decimate        EVISCERATE
    hit         devastate       MASSACRE
    injure      maim
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated in purgatory.  You must
find your way through Purgatory in order to get out back into the real world.
Miraculously, however, your gold and equipment stays with you, so apparently
you CAN take it with you.

Any spells which were affecting you, good and bad, are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is quarter-way
back to the beginning of your previous level.  Thus if you have a bad day
and die several times, the penalties won't clobber you.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

-1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
The INTELLIGENCE of a character determine three things:
a) the MANA gain per level
b) the ability of learning a spell/skill, in terms of the percentage of
   proficiency you gain per PRACTICE.
c) the mana regeneration per TICK.

Although each RACE believes its kind to be the most intelligent in the
land, it isn't quite true.  Most -- like HUMANs, DROW, HALFELVES, HOBBITs,
or HALFDWARVES -- have a rather average intelligence.  ELFs or FAERIES seem
to have a slight advantage, but are dwarved by the superb intelligence
of DRAGONs and MINDFLAYERs.  And not to forget that mass overwhelms brain;
RACEs like GIANTs, ORCs, or TROLLs show an obvious lack in this attribute.
~

-1 STRENGTH STR~
STRENGTH is a measure of physical powers, such as endurance, stamina, as well
as pure muscle.  It affects things like how much you can carry or
how heavy a weapon you can wield.  After all, how can you wield a weapon that
you can barely lift of the ground?

Of course the different RACEs do have different levels of STRENGTH.
RACEs like GIANTs, MINOTAURs, TROLLs and not to forget the good old
DRAGON have formidable STRENGTH.  Others who do not have this advantage, but
are merely average in STRENGTH, are HUMANs, ELVES, and even DWARVES.  RACEs
that do have an obvious lack are those like FAERIES.
~

-1 WISDOM WIS~
WISDOM might be one of the most important attributes for certain classes.
It seems to be a combination of a character's judgement, enlightenment,
willpower, and intuition.  Along with that, it majorly influences the
amount of practices you gain per level.

We all know that some people think they have eaten WISDOM with spoons.  It is
true that some RACEs do have a better WISDOM.  Maybe due to their close
relationship to their diety, like the DROW.  Or maybe it is because they are
GODs themselves.  Other RACEs, like GOBLINs or HOBGOBLINs, which don't seem
to understand the benefits of worshipping a diety, do show an obvious lack in
WISDOM.  Those RACEs with only average WISDOM are HUMANs, DWARVES, and ELVES.
~

-1 DEXTERITY DEX~
The attribute DEXTERITY is built up out of different things, like agility,
reflexes, balance, or speed of movement.  It affects things like
dodging a blow or anything else that is achieved by movement.

Speed and agility are of course heavily influenced by the weight and stature
of a character.  It is not very surprising that ELVES, HALFELVES,
HOBBITs or DROW have -- due to their lean stature -- certain advantages over
DWARVES, GIANTs, or OGREs whose heavy weights and square statures prove not
very helpful for this attribute.  Of course those annoying flyers (like BATs)
or a scurrying RAT have high DEXTERITY, and the otherwise formidable DRAGON
shows an obvious lack of it
~

-1 CONSTITUTION CON~
CONSTITUTION represent things like character fitness and resistance.  It
is the stat that affects the hitpoint gain per level.  Of course different
RACEs show differences in this field.  Stout RACEs like DWARVES, GIANTs,
or TROLLs have a certain advantage over RACEs like HUMANs or DROW with regards
to CONSTITUTION.  And wimpy bookworms like ELFs or HOBBITs are left behind
when it comes to bodily health.

-1 STORY~
One hundred and fifty years ago ...

Nomads from the Great Eastern desert brought spices and slaves to the Thalos
Market.  Dwarven miners, rough and rude, sold precious stones and drank the
town dry of firebreathers.  Stone golems, created by mages from the Tower of
High Sorcery, stood sentry duty in the watch towers.

It was dawn on the Day of Thunder.  The Mayor of Midgaard (great-grand-father
of today's Mayor) arrived early to pay tribute at City Hall.  He entered the
Grand Gate unchallenged.  He found the streets and markets empty.  Seeing a
nearby lamia, he asked her about the residents.  Where were all the people?

The lamia didn't act like a lamia.  Instead of answering him in the helpful but
stupid lamia manner, she stabbed the Mayor with a long, slim dagger.  Other
lamias, hearing the tumult, arrived and attacked.  The Mayor was killed.

Now Thalos is abandoned.  Wild lamias roam the streets, killing intruders and
sacrificing their bodies at the Temple of Thalos.  The golems no longer respond
to command and now watch eternally from their ruined towers.

Midgaard is next.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet.
~

0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object>
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory or equipment list.  If both
objects are weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage.
If both objects are armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
If the second object is in your equipment, COMPARE will tell you so.
Otherwise, both objects are in your inventory list.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.  It only compares
against the first item it finds; if you are wearing two cloaks, it would
only compare against the first one.

COMPARE with two arguments compares an object in your inventory with a second
object that can be either in your inventory or part of your equipment.  For
example, if you are carrying a cloak and wearing a necklace and an amulet,
you could type "compare cloak" or "compare cloak necklace"  to compare it to
the necklace, or "compare cloak amulet" to compare it to the amulet.  If you
are carrying a cloak, and wearing two cloaks, you could compare the cloak in
inventory with the first worn cloak by typing "compare cloak" or "compare
cloak 2.cloak", and against the second worn cloak by typing "compare cloak
3.cloak".  COMPARE first numbers the items down the inventory list, followed
by items in the equipment list.

If, by some chance, you were carrying two cloaks and wearing two cloaks, you
wouldn't be able to COMPARE against the second worn cloak.  We will only make
things so easy for you; the rest you have to do yourself. :)

0 CONSIDER~

advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.

interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

WARTALK sends a message to all interested members of your clan/order/guild.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

0 EMOTE , POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  ',' is a synonym for EMOTE.

POSE is a class-dependent variant of EMOTE.

SOCIAL commands are special EMOTES that give different (clever) messages
depending on the target.  "Long distance" SOCIALS are now in, so you can
perform social actions to player characters in different rooms.

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

Success depends on how well the character understands SCROLLS, WANDS, or
STAVES. See the helps on these subjects.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 SCROLLS SCROLL~

The SCROLLS skill is necessary for proper use of a scroll. The command
RECITE is used to attempt to invoke the power of the scroll.  Trying
to use a scroll without the SCROLLS skill can result in the power of the
scroll being released in an unpleasant manner.

See also: RECITE 
~

0 STAVES STAFF~

The STAVES skill is necessary for proper use of a staff.  The command
BRANDISH is used to attempt to invoke the power of the staff.  Trying
to use a staff without the STAVES skill can result in the power of the
staff being released in an unpleasant manner.

See also: BRANDISH
~

0 WANDS WAND~

The WANDS skill is necessary for proper use of a wand.  The command
ZAP is used to attempt to invoke the power of the wand.  Trying
to use a wand without the WANDS skill can result in the power of the
wand being released in an unpleasant manner.

See also: ZAP

you must practice the appropriate skill.

Also see BASH for warriors.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL~

Syntax: fill  <object>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your God.  God may reward you for the sacrifice.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.

Hint: God likes corpses.

SACRIFICE as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to sacrifice the third
one, you would type "sacrifice 3.dagger".  Or if you wanted to clean up all the
trash on the floor you would type "sacrifice all".
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, than fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
Syntax: bash <direction>

A powerful warrior can attempt to bypass the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly aggressive action, and
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
~

0 CHAMELEON 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
Syntax: chameleon

With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to change 
the appearance and coloration of his or her body, armor, and equipment to
blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective if the
psionicist remains absolutely still.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 HEIGHTEN 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
Syntax: heighten

A psionicist is able to HEIGHTEN SENSES to detect things that would otherwise
go unnoticed.
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 'POISON WEAPON'~
Syntax: poison <weapon>

With this skill, a thief can create a deadly poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires special ingredients, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.

Be Warned!  The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a GUILDMASTER to practice.  Your
GUILDMASTER will charge you a small amount of gold for your training.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 QUI~
Syntax: QUI

QUIT is a command trap to prevent you from mistakenly typing QUIT when
you dont want to.

If you want to QUIT, then type QUIT in whole. 
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, may not be
saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse will not recall at all.

See:  FLEE
~

0 SHADOW 'SHADOW FORM'~
Syntax: shadow

A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows while 
moving, having the same effect as the thief skill SNEAK.  See also VISIBLE.
~

0 SNARE UNTANGLE~
Syntax: snare    <target>
Syntax: untangle <target>

The SNARE skill will ensnare an opponent, keeping him from either moving
normally, or from fleeing from a fight.  A SNARE may be used either during
or outside of combat.  However, most creatures will react adversely to
you ensnaring them, and will try to attack.  Snares attempted outside of
combat will last longer than those created during combat.

A SNARED character can also be UNTANGLED by a nimble thief.
~

0 SPELLS~
Syntax: spells

This command shows the spell caster how much mana each spell he or she knows
will cost.

For a list of ALL available spells for your class, type SLIST.

Anyone may steal.  Those with the appropriate skill are better at it.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'move'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard atttributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana points, and movement points.  Each
of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable gain.
It also costs some of your gold for use of the training facilities, whether
improving your stats or your hp/mana/movement.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

within your area, including monsters.
~

54 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

54 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

53 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~

52 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock

to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who
lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.
Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NEWLOCK is a shortcut to NUMLOCK 1.  NEWLOCK will turn on numlock but
not turn off if currently set.

53 DENY DISCONNECT FREEZE~
Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>

the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

53 IMTLSET~
Syntax: imtlset <character> + <skill>
Syntax: imtlset <character> -
Syntax: imtlset <character>

	* Infravision.
	* Detect Hidden.
~

-1 WERERAT~
"WERERATs are a peculiar branch of the WERE family, for the condition is
hereditary rather than infectious.  In their typical form, WERERATs are
furry humanoids about the size of a GNOME adult, looking much like giant rats
standing on their hind legs....  Their other form, of course, is that of a rat.
They prefer to live underground in dimly-lit tunnels, and see well in the
dark....  Physically, WERERATs seem not as strong or as robust as HUMANs,
although they recover more quickly from physical damage.  They are also
very nimble, and prize agility above all other traits.  In fact, children who
have shown themselves to be clumsy are sacrificed in a yearly ritual, amidst
great ceremony."
	- Ruk-T'ar of the Drow Histological Academy
	  "WERE the Wild Things Are:  a Study of the Savage Were Races of
	   Envy MUD"
~

-1 HALF-KOBOLD HALFKOBOLD HLFKOBOLD~
HALFKOBOLDs are a mongrel version of the dog-like kobolds, and are about as
tall as a GNOME.  They don't have much going for them except for their
fantastic agility -- they make terrific acrobats, as travelling
sideshows have found out.  HALFKOBOLDs tend to have weak bodies and
are not very healthy, being prone to any number of canine diseases.
They are not very intellectual, spending most of their time thinking
about food, how to get food, and who will give them food.
HALFKOBOLDs have certain abilities available to them:
	* Infravision
~

-1 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
HALFOGREs are a diluted version of the OGRE race and are about the
same size.  They are not quite as strong or healthy as a full-blodded
OGRE (although they are still stronger and healthier than a HUMAN).
On the other hand, they are a little smarter and less clumsy... which
is not to say that they can outhink or outmaneuver a HUMAN!
Because they are so strong and robust, they have an advantage when
healing wounds.
HALFOGREs have certain abilities available to them.
	* Infravision
~

-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~
Minotaurs appear to be half HUMAN and half bull.  They tend to be very

caves, where they seldom worry about beauty and fashion.  They are
often seen trying to rob others for their valuables and food.  TROLLs

and everything else are just pretty items.  TROLLs are stronger than
most races, but they are not as bright and often not very agile.
~

-1 INSECT INSECTS~
Insects vary in shape, size and abilities.  They most often ignore
others.  Most INSECTs are very weak, and have almost no intelligence.

with little light.

collecting treasure, for what purpose they do this, no-one knows.

intelligent.  DRAGONs have large wings with which they can fly.
DRAGONs spend a large amount of time sleeping, but be warned they have
a great sense of smell, and can detect even the smallest scent a long
distance away.  Almost all DRAGONs have the ablity to breathe a
special substance, the most common of which is fire.  During their
long lives, DRAGONs learn to cast many spells, making them a very tough
opponent to defeat.

intelligence, but tend to be agile.  Often ANIMALs ignore other races
unless provoked.  ANIMALs include anything from SNAKEs to cats.  Most
ANIMALs have keen eyes and can see things with little light.
~

-1 GOD GODS~
Gods are a very noble race.  Very few people have ever seen a GOD, as
they often keep to themselves, and others of their kind.  Because of
their infinitely long life, they are often very wise.  GODs can cast a
lot of spells, and mortal weapons do very little damage to their mortal
incarnation.  Only the bravest of mortals dare attempt to battle with them.
~

-1 UNDEAD~
Undead are evil walking forces from the grave.  They can be anything
from skeletons to vampires.  Most UNDEAD are controlled by some
creature, and thus often have one collective intelligence.  They are
often very weak, but they seldom are seen alone, thus making them
frightening foes.  A rare few UNDEAD can cast spells, making those
tough to defeat.  Of course since the UNDEAD are not living, they are
immune to poison.
~

-1 HARPY HARPIES~
Harpies appear to be a crossbreed of woman and hawk.  They have large
wings with which they can fly very fast, combined with their razor
sharp talons, HARPIES feast on most other races.  HARPIES have a
beautiful song with which they lure males to them.  They are a fierce
race, and are very agile.  HARPIES rarely learn magic, since they have
little use for it.

found signs one had been around and the corpses of dead adventurers.
~

-1 ELEMENTAL ELEMENTALS~

and ANIMAL flesh.  WEREWOLVES regenerate hit points quicker than some
other races.
~

-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~
Goblins are some of the smelliest creatures ever created.  You don't
have to see a GOBLIN to know one is around, you just smell them out.
GOBLINS are green and quite ugly, but their skill as WARRIORs is
impressive in large groups.
~

-1 FAERIE FAERIES~
Faeries and Sprites, little creatures of the forest usually use small
bows to pierce the flesh of their enemy.  They may be flying and thus
regenerate movement more quickly than expected.
~

-1 ARACHNID ARACHNIDS~
Spiders are sometimes small and sometimes large.  No matter their
size, care should be taken as they can be poisonous.  The kingdom of
Arachnos is a justification to their importance and a tribute to the
truly dark side of magic.
~

-1 MINDFLAYER MINDFLAYERS~
Mindflayers are of GIANT size and have tentacles near where a head
should be.  Caught off guard, many adventurers have perished in the
hands of these creatures.
~

-1 OBJECT OBJECTS~

seeming desk, or chair, to become as ferocious as a bulldog.  Does the
OBJECT possess life, or is it the puppet of something greater?
~

-1 MIST MISTS~

the dark with a MIST trailing you is not a good idea.  MISTs will
regain their movement quickly so beware.
~

prey.  They can sense their prey through the body heat they give off.
In the ways of magic, a SNAKE may be able to eat a horse, or a person.
~

rock, or bones, especially in some wild thrashing movement if they are
disturbed.
~

simply seem to be waiting to be eaten while others are waiting to do
the eating.
~

-1 HYDRA HYDRAS~
A hydra is as deadly as any tentacled beast can be.  Sometimes
employed by the DROW Mothers, these creatures may be nearly unstopable
short of being buried under rock or earth.
~

-1 LIZARD LIZARDS~
Once upon a time, great lizards of enormous size dominated the world.
Today such is a rare beast to find indeed.  However, their decendents,
though smaller in size, still walk around seeking out their own prey.
The claws and teeth of any lizard can be life threatening should you
let it.
~

-1 WAR WARRIOR~
The WARRIOR class is the most basic fighting class available.  Their
battle training along with high strength and high hit points make them
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  WARRIORs train in the art of
multiple attacks.  Some master the art of a SECOND ATTACK and if experienced
enough, master a THIRD ATTACK.  Along with this training in multiple
attacks, a WARRIOR is trained in making each hit count.  ENHANCED DAMAGE
is available to only the learned.  Toward the defense side of the WARRIOR,
skills of PARRY, RESCUE and BASH DOOR allow the WARRIOR to ward off attacks,
rush to the aid of fellow comrades, and open doors rather barbarically.
~

-1 CLE CLERIC~
The CLERIC class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward
defense.  A deity gives the CLERIC spells in the curing, warding, and
protection divinities.  CLERICs being of a defensive nature fare poorly
in the art of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servants to
society or doctors to their comrades in arms.
~

-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
The MAGE class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the MAGE taps
into to influence the world.  MAGE spells are devoted to the invoking,
hermetic, and combative nature.  MAGEs fare a little better than their
CLERIC counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer to
stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL.
~

-1 THI THIEF~
The THIEF class can be characterized as a WARRIOR who dropped out of school
to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wiry persons have
physical endurance slightly less than that of a WARRIOR but are much more
agile.  Whereas a WARRIOR uses well placed weapon slashes, a THIEF seeks to
DISARM his opponent.  THIEVES also excel in the art of stealth.
An unwary opponent might not detect a THIEF until a BACKSTAB is attempted.
To achieve success in this, the skills SNEAK and HIDE are learned.  With
a THIEF's PICK LOCK and POISON WEAPON skill, a THIEF also makes the perfect
assassin for political powerhouses.
~

-1 PSI PSIONICS PSIONICIST~
The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
~

0 GHOST~
When traveling in the night, beware of GHOSTS.  Fortunately, sunlight is
a bane for these representatives of the dead.
~

0 'ADRENALINE CONTROL'~
Syntax: cast 'adrenaline control' 

By controlling the production and release of adrenaline in his or her system, 
the psionicist can gain temporary boosts in dexterity and constitution.  This 
control cannot be initiated during battle because, hey, even psionicists get a 
little excited from time to time.
~

0 AGITATION~
Syntax: cast 'agitation' <character>

This skill is nearly identical to the Mage spell BURNING HANDS.  With this 
skill, a psionicist can cause the cells in his or her victim to become
agitated, moving so fast as to cause burn damage.
~

0 AWE~
Syntax: cast 'awe' <character>

With this discipline, a skilled psionicist can use the power of his or
her mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy
will be overcome by awe for the psionicist, and will simply forget to
fight.  Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature
after only a brief lull in the action.
~

0 'BALLISTIC ATTACK'~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <character>

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to throw 
small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in the area,
at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the psionicist, and
painful to the victim.
~

0 'BIOFEEDBACK'~
Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of blood 
through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to reduce
bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively reducing
the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
~

0 'CELL ADJUSTMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'

A skilled psionicist can also perform CELL ADJUSTMENT, which can remove both 
curses and poisons from his or her body.
~

0 'COMBAT MIND'~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her 
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an 
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize the 
damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathic, this 
knowledge can also be shared with his or her companions.
~

0 'CONTROL FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'control flames' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can will the flames in his or her light source to
leap out and strike an enemy.  And if you don't think your light source uses a 
flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close enough.
~

0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.
~

0 'DETONATE'  'DISINTEGRATE'~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <character>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <character>

With both of these skills, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the 
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to 
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most 
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to be 
SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists can DETONATE 
objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists can even
DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~

0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'
  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast 'displacement'
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an 
armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other 
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the damage 
infliced by creatures of negative energy.
~

0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended 
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~

0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or 
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of 
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~

0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy 
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~

0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects, 
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.

Obviously if the item is too complicated for the caster, there are higher
chances something will go wrong.
~

0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' 'ULTRABLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <character>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <character>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <character>
Syntax: cast 'ultrablast'    <character>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the neural 
synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in increasing order of
damage inflicted.
~

0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~

0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <character>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind will 
strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~

0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~

0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.
~

0 'METEOR SWARM'~
Syntax: cast 'meteor swarm'

This high level magic-user spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in
the room. Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack you
as a result! It may only be cast out of doors.
~

0 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax: cast 'chain lightning' <character>

This magic-user spell inflicts heavy damage on the victim and if it has enough
power, on every other character in the room. Beware that other characters who
are not yet fighting may attack you as a result!  This includes other players
as well!  If the lightning doesn't find a target and still has power on it will
strike the caster himself...
~

0 'VORTEX LIFT'~
Syntax: cast 'vortex lift' <character>

location somewhere in the world.

~

0 SCRIBE BREW~
A spell caster of sufficient level holding a 'clean parchment' or 'empty vial'
may transform them into spelled scrolls or potions via the scribe and
brew commands.

It takes significantly more mana to bind a spell to a potion or scroll
than to simply cast it.
~

0 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <character>

The portal spell creates a lasting one-way portal to the target creature.
Portals are entered using 'enter' command, as in 'enter portal'.  Portals
cannot be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof
rooms.  Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

0 NEXUS~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <character>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...

0 MANA~
Long ago, when the world was young and the Nordwar's hatred had long since
been quelled by the death throes of battle, the council of elders began to
study the amazing gems left on Tyselorrd from ancient times.  The gems
allow a person to harness the power of the internal crystal and focus it
into a useful energy.  This release of energy is in the form of spells.
Each gem can be used for a specific element.  Some rare gems can be used
for multiple elements.  Different spells use different elements to fuel
the magic.  Each gem holds a specific amount of mana, and when this mana
is depleted, the gem implodes and shatters into thousands of tiny, unusable
shards.

See also: 'THE ELEMENTS'
~

0 MAGIC~
To cast spells, first you have to learn them.  Then practice makes perfect
when attempting to successfully cast.  Finally, the use of gems for the
empowering of spells is highly recomended.  Using gems you can save your
precious inner mana. Inner mana is automagically converted into any required
element unlike gem mana.

See also: MANA
~

0 'THE ELEMENTS'~
The elements are as follows:

EARTH
Nature, the earth, controls mending and binding magic.  The earth shields
and heals.  It is the element of earth that holds the most powerful healing
spells, and it is also this element which can be used to thwart dangerous
foes.

AIR
Air controls travel and visibility, twisting and bending lights and shadow.
Air conceals, and it also can forcefully move like the winds of powerful
storms.

FIRE
Fire allows the unseen to glow brightly, to light the darkest room and to
burn harshly the most evil.  Fire allows a person to see the truth behind
the dark shrouds that covertly conceal many.

WATER
Water, the cleansing spirit, dominates and overcomes with unfolding strength.
It is a holy thing, coveted and used to help cure the sickest and vilest of
diseases, whether those diseases be plagues of the heart or of the mind.
