Rock Outcropping~
From this rock outcropping the valley below seems peaceful, untouched.
Dense forests of pine carpet the mountainsides, broken only by thick aspen 
woods. The mountains, deep blue in the distance, circle the valley floor and 
form a soft highland bowl.
There is a sign nailed to a nearby tree.

Twin Flat~
A clear mountain valley sprawls about. To the northwest and southeast,
thick vallenwoods flash yellow and scarlet against the bright autumn sky.
To the east shimmers the cool blue of the Crystalmir Lake. Westward, the
valley enters a canyon rimmed by granite cliffs. The valley floor itself
continues to the northeast.
Some distance away, a group of huddled men pulls a large cart slowly
west down the Haven road. They sway rhythmically. Coarse, heavy robes
completely conceal their features.
