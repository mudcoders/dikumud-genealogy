feature on him is the fact that his right hand is missing.  Obviously he was
caught stealing some time ago, and forced into retirement by both the lack
of his good hand, and the shame of being caught.

~
E
one~
&RThe town of Ravenwood was founded years ago in order to provide those
of us who wish to live the so-called life of evil a place where we may be
welcome by all.  Our purpose is to build our forces and eventually wipe out
the desecrators who inhabit Bethaven.  You citizenship requires that you
assist in defending the town at all costs.  The forces of good must be
stopped before they control the entire world!  
~
E
three~
&CWithin Ravenwood we have provided a guild hall for each of the known
classes.  Useful for gathering with your fellow warrior/mage/whatever for a
drink and to discuss class business.  Other classes are prohibited from
these areas, please respect the code of honor we have set forth.  
~
E
four~
&PIn the case of an attack on Ravenwood, we have set up an underground
tunnel system, designed to allow lower levels a place to hide, or to allow
travel from one point in the town to another without detection.  The
manholes are set in the following locations: 
 
&WBefore the Temple Stairs
Ravenwood Center
Gateway Plaza
At the western and eastern ends of Hangmans Way
All 4 corners of the city.
 
&PThis gives a total of 9 manholes. Use them wisely.
Also note, at the Southeast and Southwest corners of the city lies a secret passage through the walls to the outside of the town gates. Use this to help reinforce the gates in case of an attack.
~
E
five~
&YThis book was designed and written for the citizens of &zRaven&Owood
&Yby the founder of the town, &CGrunt U.  Neanderthal&Y.  Do not allow it to
fall into the wrong hands.

Within a Jail Cell~
Chains and shackles line the walls here, in this prison set under the
ground.  The only exit is a trapdoor which is set above a small ladder.  The
trapdoor is heavily locked and appears as thought it could only be opened
from above.
