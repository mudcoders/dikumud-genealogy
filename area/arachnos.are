Name        A Leader Strand~
Descr
This strand is weightier, more sturdy.  It shimmers as you step on
it.  You are definitely not in the Midgaardian realms anymore.  Just
where you are you can't tell.  It feels like you're moving through
ether.  You can still get back down to more surer lands.

area.
