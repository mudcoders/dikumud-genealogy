Descr
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

prisoners survive long enough to spend much time in these dank dungeons.

Name        Below the stagnant pool~
Descr
As you dive beneath the putrid waters, you feel a strong tug and a whirlpool
drags you under.  You are sucked into blackness.  You feel your lungs burst
from lack of oxygen.  Just as you feel your life fading, you notice a change in
direction ... and are sucked under by a rip tide.

to those of the upper echelon of mages. The walls here emit a faint blue
magical aura which provides some light.

you can barely make out a stairway leading up.
