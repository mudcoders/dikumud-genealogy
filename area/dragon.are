You look in the eyes of a gorgeous young woman. Just recently, she has been
abducted by the Dragons, but she seems to be very happy here. Against

enjoy the beauty of these human females.

The Wyrm wears a strange pair of spectacles, probably the latest in dragon
fashions.

An Overlook~
You are at the entrance to a large and wonderous valley that stretches
out here to the north.  A large rock in front of you seems to be carved out
into some sort of throne.  A mountain, to trecherous to climb juts out of
the earth in front of you to the north.

Welcome to the Dragon Valley! This area is mostly for higher 
level characters, but there are some low level mobs as well.
The Area is listed as Level 25 - 100.
 
Most of this area is no recall except for specifically marked rooms.
Make sure to read all the other Runestones along the way, for they
will give you much insight in the secrets of the Dragon Valley.
 
Enjoy, Nosferatu!

chalice? It seems you will need it soon.
Near the road is a small clear mountain lake. Many colourful birds roams the

rocks with some strong acid. 
Nearby, you notice and old and rusty grate on the ground. It appears to be
locked tightly. Another Runestone stands here as well.

the west all things are covered with some disgusting yellow slime.
A large, dragonshaped fountain marks this small square. The water from it
is fresh and clear...and you feel very thirsty all of a sudden.

into something that could be best described as a swamp hole, while to the 
west the land and trees are covered with show and ice. A chilling breeze
blows from that direction clearing the air from the swamp gas that drifts
from the east.
Nearby, you notice a large hole in the ground. It is covered with a strong
lit that shines in all the colours of the rainbow!

giant tree, almost as high as the surrounding mountains. West of here,
you can see a barren path...the wind carries the sweet smell for decaying 
flesh from that direction.

In order to reach the famed shops of the land of the Dragons, you must

is a very large and very nasty viper.  Even as you try to sneak past it, it
rears up in preparation to strike.

the mamba will be no small feat, however.  The immense size of the snake
sends quivers through your legs.  Incensed by the interruption into its pit,
it strikes out toward you.

Dragons roasting entire villages of people are carved into the walls, a
sight that makes you uncomfortable even though aggressions between mortals
and Dragons is long in the past.

The lair of the dragon prince is opulent.  Large piles of jewels and
coins lie strewn about him, and some of the jewels can be seen encrusting
his body.  Apparently, the many years of sitting on the jewels caused them
to become a part of his skin.  He looks like he would be a formidable enemy
despite the years of apparent laziness.  The stench of dragon and the acrid
scent of smoke fill your nostrils.

The Way Out...~
You have discovered the way out of the tests.  The dragons, knowing that
foolish mortals will often attempt to gain entrance into their domain, have
offered a way out other than death.  Not the incredibly cold-hearted beasts
that most people believe they are, the dragons are actually very
compassionate.  The only request they make of the mortals is that they be
left in peace.  Knowing this won't happen, though, they devised the tests to
keep them out.  They also have employed the assistance of Garby to tend the
wounds of the mortals lucky enough to escape the trials.

skeletons pile up so high that it's nearly impossible for you to proceed any 
deeper into this cavern.

Cave of the Skeletal Drake~
As you enter this cave, you immediately sense your mistake.  A huge
dragon made entirely of bone looms far overhead.  The things only nightmares
are made of, the dragon looks surprisingly substantial and ominous despite
having no flesh.  As it moves to attack, you can hear the clicking of bone
against bone.

At a Giant Tree~
You are at the base of a gigantic tree.  Its top seems to be as high as
the snow covered mountains nearby.  Huge, leafy branches hide a substancial
part of this area from the sunlight.  Many animals are all around its
moss-covered trunk and its immense roots.  To the east, you spy a small path
partially overgrown by shrubbery.

You have reached the lower branches of the ancient tree. Beams of sunlight

birds, squirrels and many insects are in this area of the tree.
As you look up, you can tell you still have a long way to go to reach the
tree top.

are small huts made from the leaves and branches of the trees. Lots of small
winged humanoids are flying and playing in the air. When they notice you, 
they get very curious. Some of them bolt out of the sky to give you a hug
or a kiss, then, with much giggling they soar back up in the air...

The steep slope you are walking on is covered with vegetation of all
kinds.  Mostly, however, it is covered with beautiful blue flowers of all
kinds.  Used to seeing destruction, you take a moment to relax, breathe some
fresh air, and enjoy the flowers.

Before a Blue Cave~
You stand in front of the cave of the Blue Dragon.  A low rumbling sound
can be heard inside, and a soft sibilant voice as well.  You try to get the
attention of the Dragon inside by knocking on the door, but there is no
answer and you only hurt your hand.

Lair of the Blue Dragon~
Expecting the worse, you carefully pull open the cave entrance and walk
in.  A splendid looking blue dragon raises its graceful head and peers at
you intently, then blinks.  Prepared for an all-out battle, you are
surprised when she opens her mouth and greets you happily.  After talking
with her for a day and a half, though, you think maybe death would have been
better.

On a Weatherbeaten Trail~
The trail becomes wider and somewhat difficult to traverse here, and the
weather has begun to drop in temperature.  The trail continues to the north
and south from this point, and looks to be in horrible shape.

A Slimey Slope~
Traveling up the slope would be hard enough if the ground were rough, but
it is covered with a disgusting and sticky goo.  Every footstep is
precarious, and you slip and fall on your face several times.  The slime not
only looks putrid, but it smells disgusting too.

Before a Slimey Cave~
Yellow slime drips down the sides of this cave.  From the inside of the
cave, you think you can hear the low rumble of a Dragon breathing.  All
around you, slime is covering everything, and you feel like you have landed
in a giant sneeze.

Lair of the Yellow Dragon~
The lair of the Yellow Dragon is slippery and sticky with yellow slime. 
Although the idea of a frost dragon or a fire dragon does not surprise you,
you had no idea that there could also be a slime dragon.  You are just about
to laugh when a large and slimey head rears up from the floor.  After one
piercing and furious gaze at you, the Yellow Dragon opens its mouth to
attack.

Swampland~
The foul, hideous odor of the swamp is overpowering, and you afraid you
will pass out into the murk of the swamp.  With every footstep you seem to
sink deeper into the swamp, and the sucking sound the mud makes at your
boots is disgusting.  A small set of red, beady eyes stares at you from the
brush surrounding the swamp.

Before a Swamp Hole~
You are standing before a very large swamp hole.  You can't imagine what
could possibly be big enough to have made such a hole, but you guess it must
be a Dragon Lord.  Surely only the most foul and evil of the Dragons would
choose to live in this disgusting place.  A swamp snake strikes out at you,
and you chop it in half just in the nick of time.

Lair of the Black Dragon~
The lair of the Black Dragon is actually nothing more than a big hole in
the swamp.  In the middle of it is the Black Dragon himself.  Swamp ooze
slides of his scales as he rises up out of the hole to tower over you. 
Puffs of thick, acrid smoke come out of his nostrils, and his eyes burn with
an unholy fire.  He seems to be the most incredibly cruel Dragon you have
ever met.

Arctic Wasteland~
Trudging up the mountain path is almost impossible.  A huge howling ice
and snow storm surrounds you, tugging at your clothes and chilling you to
the bone.  Snow drifts up to three meters high dwarf you, and they are
almost impossible to cross.

Before an Icy Cave~
You are before a cave made entirely out of ice.  Through the thick
glass-like walls, you think you can see a large creature moving.  A rumbling
and creaking sound clues you into the nature of the beast.  It must be the
home of the Ice Dragon!

Lair of the White Dragon~
The lair of the White Dragon is blindingly bright.  Sun streams down
through the ice walls, illuminating everything within.  The White Dragon
does not seem pleased to see you, and from the look in her yes, you can tell
she considers attacking you.  She must not find you worth her while,
however, for she does not attack.  It might be a good idea to get out of
here before she changes her mind, though.

and the crunch of the branches sends chills up your spine.  This area is
down-right creepy.

choose to live in this bizarre cave.

Lair of the Silver Dragon~
The Silver Dragon is a truly magnificent creature.  Here on the inside of
the cave, the walls have been left unpolished, making them seem dull in
coparison with the Dragon Lady.  Always concerned about the reception you
will receive from the Dragon Lords and Ladies, you approach her cautiously. 
She seems pleased to see you however, and offers you a seat in a beautiful
silver throne.

A Golden Slope~
A thin layer of gold dust covers everything in this area.  You reach out
and touch a leaf, and the gold dust sticks to your finger.  You are amazed
and curious by this strange dust.  It appears to be real gold, but you have
no idea how it could have gotten here.  The amount of powder looks like it
could add up to a fortune, though.

The Gold Dragon is a splendid creature.  His scales sparkle and shimmer,
and he towers high above you, his head almost reaching the ceiling of his
lair.  Being a very vain Dragon, he has absolutely no gold of any kind in
his lair, afraid that it might outshine him.  Instead, he has every possible
color of gemstone, and the rainbow colors are magnificent.
