which looks very functional.  There is one painting on the wall, you can't

********  WARNING  ********
This area is not for level grubbers.  It can be very
dangerous, and you could die, and even loose your
corpse.  It was designed to be a challenging area
with many secrets and some cool EQ, but if you plan
on an easy ride forget it, it's not here.

The Chamber of the High Priestess~
You have entered the Bed Chamber of the High Priestess.  Now you're in
trouble.  The high priestess is rumored to fornicate with Dragons,
some even say that she is half Dragon herself... but a half Dragons and
Dragons in Midgaard? Impossible.

Chamber of the Wyrmling~
You have discovered what the Cult was hiding, and if the Black Dragon
Wyrmling didn't "tell" you himself, the gnawed bones and large piles
of Dragon defecation should.  And they were intending on feeding another
virgin to this horrible creature.  You shudder to think what this
Wyrmling will be like if it ever grows up.  The only exit is to the South.

People are running around in odd clothes, moving papers from one place to
another.  There is a shrill ringing sound, and then they pick up these
things and put it up to their ears and mouths.  This sort of place is
not meant to exist.

This is a pretty normal place in an odd sort of way.  The
craftsmanship seems incredible compared to the Inns you've been to in
the past, but all in all it is a very ordinary building.  There is a
picture on the wall.  Exits are South, back to the main part of the
office, and there is a glass wall and open door to the west... there
is some lettering in the glass.

she runs her own office.  Gale is the backbone behind the business
side of the organization.  The employee's don't even bother with Fred,
the boss, they just come here.  There is a desk here with some papers
on it and some certificates on the wall. The only way out is back to the east.

anything ever gets done in here, or maybe not so, because nothing ever really
does get done in here.  A huge desk is in the middle of the room, and the

A back hallway~
This is a hallway that people to sneak around, just in case.  It is
not used very much, except by Fred and Marie who come in here to
discuss cleaning sometimes.  Oh yeah then Bob and Marie also use this back
area too.  But never Bob and Fred oh no that would cause trouble, though Fred
wouldn't mind using this hallway with Gale, that wouldn't be bad at all, But
secretly Gale wants to use the hallway with Bob, but Bob doesn't know this and
spends his time in here with Marie, wishing that Marie looked like Cindy (no
there is no Cindy in this area). Oh well maybe this hallway is used alot.
