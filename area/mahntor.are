Name        The dark woods~
Descr
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

Name        The dark woods~
Descr
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

Name        Before the huge tree~
Descr
You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

The stench is overwhelming. You can hardly breathe as you enter the cave.

rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.
