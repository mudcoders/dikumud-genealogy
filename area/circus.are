Mayor and City council.  He makes it a point to let you know that he knows

This tent consists of chairs for you to rest in, and a rickety wooden
stage up front.  You hear the stage creak as you enter, and you understand
why when you see who is standing on it.  She is bearded all right.  And big.
Very big.  Colossally huge.  You don't seem to have any problem finding a seat.
The place is deserted of spectators.

The Tent of the Illusionist~
This tent is darkened at first.  Then it gradually lightens, although
you do not see the source of the light.  You do hear a loud breathing sound
though.  You think it may be coming from right behind you.  You think this 
because you can feel very warm breath on the back of your neck.  You turn,
and see a very large, very evil looking creature.  It's a Dragon.  It opens 
its mouth, but does not attack.  Instead it just laughs at you mercilessly.
The Dragon snorts a cloud of smoke at you.

The noise of the crowd greets you as you enter the Big Top.  The 
sounds and smells that greet you take you back to the time when you were a
child, in wonder and awe of the Circus that came to your town.  You can hear
the trumpet of an elephant somewhere, and the roar of a lion.  The applause
of the crowd is momentarily deafening.  To the west and east you see under

First Look at the Big Top~
You receive your first good look at the Big Top.  The size of this
tent was amazing from the outside, but is even more breathtaking from the 
inside.  You feel as if you are in a different world, where the sky is only
a little closer.  You see 3 Rings spread out in front of you.  A high wire
extends between poles at a dizzying height.  The 1st Ring appears to hold
a cage which contains several large lions.  The 2nd Ring is filled with clowns
who are trying to fit into a small carriage.  In the 3rd Ring, a man is 
preparing to put on a blind fold, while his assistant stands against a target.
He has a rack of knives next to him.  You may enter the 2nd Ring to the south.
To the east and west are the Grand Stands, and the Entryway is to the north.

The 2nd Ring - You'd better read the description of this room. ~
You are in the 2nd Ring.  You see a rickety carriage, which a line of
clowns are trying to squeeze into.  You've already seen many more fit into it
than could possibly fit.  The 1st Ring is to the west and the 3rd Ring is 
to the east.  A ladder on a pole here provides access to the tightrope above.
To the north is the first look a visitor to the Big Top has.  You notice that 
the 1st ring is a cage which contains several HUNGRY Lions.  Entering it would
be fairly suicidal.  It is a good thing it is locked!

You are still 80 feet up in the air.  DIRECTLY below you is the Lion's
Cage.  If you survived the fall, YOU WOULD SURELY DIE when the Lions got ahold
of you.  You note that the door is closed to the cage, so you would have very
little chance of running away if you did fall into the cage.  As you take
your eyes off the ground below, you see the end of the wire immediately to

did survive the fall, you probably wouldn't feel like adventuring again.

Penned underneath this is a note that says:  Beware the Bear!!!  

You may enter the Elephant Pen to the west, the Bear Pen to the south, or

practices on the side to make a little extra cash.  He also keeps a rather

all the objects in the room have a slight shimmer to them.  Closer examination
reveals that the bed is a cot, the table a nightstand, and the sitting room
is a chair.  It appears the Illusionist tries to fool even himself sometimes.
