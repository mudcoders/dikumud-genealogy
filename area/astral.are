E
gate~
You see a huge, glowing gate wrought from an incredibly hard translucent 
material.  Each of the intricately carved bars of this mighty gate are about 
as thick as a man's wrist, rising from the floor to a height of forty feet.  
A plaque is inset into the wall next to one side of the gate.

Into the Astral Plane~
You step through the gate, and into another reality...

   You find yourself floating in a field of blackness, filled with tiny tendrils
of silvery light and insubstantial shining motes of dust.  The weightlessness
of this environment is very disorienting, although it is not too late to return
through the gate to the south.
