Stan~
Stan~
Stan the undertaker is looking for some corpses to bury.
~
Stan is an interesting man in his early 40's.  He is not particularly
handsome at first glance, but there is something that draws you to him. 
Maybe it's his soft dark eyes, or possibly the intonation of his voice. 
More likely, however, it is a concoction of pheremones he collected from
various dead insects.  He reminds you somewhat of a biology professor, and
you can imagine him out in the field collecting insects and putting them in
dead jars.  The mud on his boots and the stench of the grave betray his
occupation, however.  Stan is an undertaker, and he loves his work..

Maze of Tombstones~
You are wandering aimlessly in a maze of tombstones.  The ground is very
uneven here, and you trip and stumble often.  There seems to be no method to
the tombstones; they are laid out will-nilly all over the place.  Hopefully,
you know which way you are going.

Finally, you have reached the end of the tombstones.  Just up ahead to
the north, the ancient and decrepit mansion looms above you.  The windows
are shuttered, and an old door hangs in the doorway.  Terrible noises which
might be caused by the wind can be heard around the perimeter of the
building as well as inside it.  To your east, you spy a small and ancient
looking pathway.

Bedroom~
There is a door in the eastern wall which leads out into the main hall. 
The tattered remains of a rug lie on the floor, and the walls of this room
are a heavily patterned forest green color.  The wallpaper is peeling and
faded, and the room smells extremely musty.

in.  A comb and a basin of water stand on a table here.

Bedroom~
The carpeting in this room is in good condition.  Plush and of a very
elaborate design, it looks like it was installed yesterday.  The wallpaper,
too, is in very good condition, and not a single piece is faded.  It is
almost as if someone was living here.  But that couldn't be possible, could
it?

Bedroom~
A large four-post bed is standing here in the corner of the room. 
Curtains run along all sides of it, forming an enclosed bed.  Afraid of what
you will find, you pull back the curtains exposing a freshly made bed.  You
breathe a sigh of relief, but you can't help being a little nervous.  Where
is the inhabitant of this room, and why is he living here?

Bedroom~
A painting of a young and beautiful woman hangs in the corner here.  Her
long blonde hair cascades over her pale white shoulders, and her soft ruby
lips give you a sensuous smile.  She is wearing a soft rose gown, and the
soft curves of the material accuentuate the curves of her body.  On a table
beneath the picture, a single fresh red rose lies.  An unexplainable chill
runs up and down your spine.

Under the Staircase~
A staircase rises up into the darkness of the attic above you.  You have
the feeling that you are very close to your goal, intangible though it is. 
The pounding of your heart in your chest echoes in your ears as you place
your foot on the first step.  It's now or never...

there are footprints in the dust going south.

branch against the building, making a tapping sound.

Sanctuary of the Madman~
As you move into this area from behind a stack of boxes, a man turns
furiously on you.  As he turns, he reveals a corpse wearing a long, flowing
wedding dress.  She is laid out on a table as if sleeping, but her badly
decomposed body tells you that she's no sleeping beauty that will wake up
with a kiss.  A dark stain over her left breast gives you just a hint of
what is going on here.  The madman sees your glance and begins to rant at
you without making a sound you can hear.
