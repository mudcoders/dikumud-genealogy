-1 DEALER CROUPIER~
Each gambling game must have someone in charge, and this person is 
traditionally known as a CROUPIER.  For card games, the term DEALER is
more common.  The CROUPIER is in total control of the game, and can
turn away unwelcome customers.  Keep your eyes out, though...some of 
the croupiers have been known to take advantage of unwary players.

0 BET WAGER~
Syntax: bet   <amount>
Syntax: bet   <amount> <choice>
Syntax: bet    limit
Syntax: wager <amount>
Syntax: wager <amount> <choice>
Syntax: wager  limit

During a gambling game, you will occasionally need to place a BET.  The
syntax of the wager will depend on the particular game in which you are
participating.  Wagering the 'limit' will automatically place the maximum
bet, if you have enough gold.

You stand at the path to the Mythran Mud casino.  To the north you see
the casino istself.  It doesn't seem to be big, but thart's probably not to
draw attentions.  Since the Mayor illegalized gambling things are more
difficult.

SEVEN is a simple dice game.  You place a BET with a choice of under,
seven, or over.  The dealer then rolls two dice, and their values are added
up.  If the result is 8 or greater, it is an "Over", and if the resut is 6
or less, it is a "Under".  If, however, the result is seven, it is a "Seven"
and those who bet on it win back 5 times their wager!

The High-Dice Room~
The high-dice room...  High dice is the simplest game to play of them
all.  You don't even have to say a thing.  Just place your bet and the
croupier will know what do with your money... He looks kind of dodgy and you
remember that sign on the closed down circus games booths.  A sign is here.
