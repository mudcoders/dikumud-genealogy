Entrance to a Valley in the Highlands.~
Before you the path just stops. It doesn't go any further. A mysterious bog 
begins here, if you dare entering it's at your own risk. 
Also in the distance you see a vague contour of hills. On the top of 
the hills you see lights.

A guard barracks.~
A troop of guards is in here busy with the upkeep of their equipment.
At first they don't notice you but then one looks up and screams
an alarm, they all look up and attack you on sight. It was
not very smart move coming in here.
