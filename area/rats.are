0 HATCHET~
Hatchet is a Merc Guy.  He founded Merc with Kahn one day in 1992 because one
day, when he complained about muds, the imps said, 'If you have a problem, go 
make your own mud.'  His love is for the mudders, specifically a lady named 
Icaza.
~

0 ICAZA~
Icaza is a Goddess of the mud realm.  She is currently being pursued by Hatchet
of Merc.  Her smiles are contagious, and her Southern accent is intriguing.

		Proposal
	I am enchanted by you.
	So easily you have captured my heart.
	And so happy I am when I think of you,
	My life I wish you to be a part.

	I am in love with you,
	After only knowing you for time so short.
	It is your love that I now woo,
	Your hand I now quietly court.

	I am lonely without you,
	You are so vital to my life.
	So I now humbly beg of you,
	Susan, please be my wife.

	I read a poem to my love,
	One that comes to me unbidden.
	It is a simple poem, written by simple me,
	but writing such a poem
	makes me laugh, and it makes her cry
	And I know that at that very moment,
	we are both experiencing the same emotion, Love.

		Little Girl

One day, I happened upon a little girl,
Sitting on the stump of a tree.
She was dressed in blue, head full of curls,
And she was smiling at me!

"Hello, dear old man," she says to me.
"I'm going to Wonderland!
If you would like to come join me,
Please, take hold of my hand!"

I had barely touched her hand,
When she ran off at a tear,
Pulling me to a far away land
That only she knew where.

I watched this girl run like the fire,
She must be under twenty.
But she didn't slow, she didn't tire,
While I hobbled behind, panting aplenty.

Suddenly, we both started flying,
With the Earth shrinking behind.
I thought I must be dying,
Or just losing my mind!

"Where are we going, what is your name?",
I yelled to the little girl.
But nothing will distract this dame,
As through a hole we hurl.

I was suddenly filled with white light.
Wondering what would next happen.
But then I was no longer afright,
As I saw what must be Heaven!

Tranquil plains blossomed before my eyes
As we came down to land.
I looked around, from green grass to blue skies.
This must be Wonderland!

We finally stopped, our destination here,
As we came upon a grand plaza.
She leaned over, whispered to my ear,
"I am Goddess Icaza."

Inspired by and dedicated to the fair lady Icaza.

A Storage Room~
You are in a storage room.  Weapons and some armor are on the floor.  Most are
broken, however, so they are useless to you.  The exit is to the east.

A Stairway~
You are on a landing of an old stairway.  The stairs creak as you put any 
pressure on it, and the combined gloom of this place gives you the creeps. 
The stairs lead both up and down, and a hallway is to the south.

You are in a roughly dug room, about 20 paces by 20 paces, and 8 paces high.
A table is in the center, with about a dozen chairs surrounding it.  A lit
torch is on a wall, and you can tell that someone must do some upkeep here, 
because the obnoxious smell is less in this room.  The exit is down the

A Small Shrine~
You are in a small room.  For some reason, this room is much cleaner
than the others in this decrepit area.  A candle burns smokelessly on a table
in the middle of the room, and a small shrine is against the far wall.  The
occupants of this area must avoid this room for some reason.  Some words are
inscribed next to the shrine.  The exit is to the north.  A strange portal is
to the west.

You are in a large room.  Walls made of a golden substance harder than titanium
and atlantium rise high to the ceilings.  Paintings, tapestries, and other
beautiful objects of art merge into the walls, as if they are part of the
walls themselves.  Two large thrones are in the center of this room.  A large
door wrought from a platinum-like metal is to the north, and an equally large
door wrought from a gold-like metal is to the south.  The other exit from this
room is the hallway to the east, and a mysterious portal to the west.

You are in a small, cluttered room.  You are amazed by the amount of trash in
this room, especially compared to the large, opulent room this is connected to.
A picture of the fair lady Icaza is on a wall, next to a Cindy Crawford
calendar.  You can hear the song 'Somewhere Out There' in the background.  The

creaks of it's own will on the hardwood floors.  You can see a stuffed ducky
and a stuffed piggie on the bed.  This bed looks like it's for display use
only, as the owner of this room must sleep somewhere else.  You can hear the 
ringing of a small bell in the background.  The exit is to the north.

You are in a large room.  Strangely, you see THREE beds in this room, a large
brass bed, an equally large waterbed, and a smaller low futon.  All three look
used, as if the owners of this room use all three beds depending on their 
moods.  The smell of roses and perfumes permeates this room, and you can hear 
some soft jazzy music (Kenny G?) in the background.  There is no mortal exit 
from this room.
