to the east, you can see an intersection.

You have entered a guard room.  Its furnishings are crude, and unimpressive.
In general, there are a few tables, a couple chairs but nothing much else that
seems important.  There is a large pile of dung in the corner of the room, 
which smells particularly bad.  Rusted swords lay about, and it seems that a
strange game involving sticks had been played upon the table.

you as you walk through the sludge.  A hallway leads east from this cell.

wall, and a few strange rocks, but other than that, there is nothing strange.

moving water.  In the distance, you can hear footsteps, but they are almost

south you can make out a cave-like entrance.  The sound of the waterfall is
quite loud here, and seems to be coming from all around.

the sound of water rushing quickly.  The walls of the cavern are extraordinarily
smooth, due to the effects of erosion.  This cavern sends a chill through your
spine, and you can feel evil within it.  A passage leads south into the dark
cavern, and north to a hallway.

water seems to be coming from the far east, as does the roaring sound of the
waterfall.  To the north, lies the entrance to this cavern underground.

dark tunnel, which looks considerably drier.

Great Waterfall~
You are standing on a large rock, which looks over the cliff.  Gallons of water
flow over the edge, falling hundreds of feet to the bottom of the cavern below.
The sound of the waterfall is deafening, and you clench your ears to cut the
noise down.  You notice a series of rocks, following the cliff downwards.
To the north, the river continues.

You have come to a very large, underground river.  The water is quite deep in
places, and is moving rather quickly to the south.  From the south, a fresh
cloud of water vapor covers your body in a cool dampness.  The river is at a
dangerously wild state.  A passage leads back to the west.

cavern walls.  Before you lies the largest pool of water you have ever seen.
It seems to span the entire cavern, and the waters splash back and forth, as
a mighty river from the north pours into the room.  As you look east, you see
that a larger river seems to be flowing eastward, very quickly.

Underground River~
You have come to a large river, spanning the cavern.  To the south, the river
seems to soar off of the cliff, forming a large waterfall, over a drop of at
least a hundred feet.  The swirling river waters are extremely swift, and deep
even near the edge.  To the west you see a large pool, from which this river
seems to originate.

screaming coming from within the cave.  A set of rocks lies against the wall
of the cliffside here.

water to be found.  Bones litter the floor, and there are several tables set
up in the room.  Against the northern wall, there is a large, stone throne, 
and against the western wall, you see a rather large chest.  Also, you notice
a smaller cave to the east.
