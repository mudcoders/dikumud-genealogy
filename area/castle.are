Field of Death~
The stench of death nearly overpowers you when you enter 
this area. There must be 200 dead farm animal carcasses 
scattered about the land. Arrows and spears rise from 
the dead like a wild field of saplings and there must be      
a thousand campfires scattered about.  Sure signs of wagons 
and horses lead South, and a path leads east.

A scrap of paper is stuck on a stick...it flaps in the breeze.

Burnt Village~
Rising streamers of smoke spiral into the air from the smoldering 
ruins of a poor village. Of the twelve buildings only one wall is 
higher than three feet.  This village has been brutally taken apart 
and the only sign of life that you can detect  is a large buzzard 
still digging at the corpse of a villager.

With the village disappearing behind you the road to Castle Reinhold 
begins to climb upward.  In the distance, past the small stands of 
trees mixed with the farmlands, you see the castle.  It sits upon a 
high hill overlooking the Rhein River, commanding a strategic position 
over the river.  Many an army has beat itself to death upon the Castle.

length of the fifty foot long bridge. On the other side of the bridge 
you see a cobblestone road leading uphill towards the castle .

This path is actually large enough for wagons.  As a matter of fact, 
you see many signs that wagons have passed this way. If you listen 
very hard you will detect, over the sound of the rushing river, sounds 
of wood chopping.  Looking ahead you see tiny strands of smoke rising 
into the air.

You have walked into the middle of a rough logging camp.  Trees are 
falling in the distance, and axe carrying men are moving about the camp.
Unlike most camps, this one has women and children.  How strange this is.  
**  WAIT **  What are those guards doing here?  It appears that you have 
walked into part of the besieging army's camp.  The loggers are cutting 
trees for siege engines.

Cobblestone Road~
After crossing the granite bridge, you feel some relief to be back 
on solid ground. The Cobblestones were obviously quarried from the 
area and with great skill the craftsmen of the Castle fitted them 
together to form a magnificient road.  
You wonder if humans did the work or if Dwarven craftsmen did it. 
Hhmmmm. Ahead of you...drifting on the slight breeze from the chasm, 
you detect the sound of a loud voice.  Someone ahead is shouting.

AAAAAaaahhhhhhhh.  The view from this narrow curving road is tremendous.
Far below you the Rhein River winds its way through the mountains.  
It's green color matching the  few plants along its banks. 
To the East you can make out Castle Reinhold.  The three walls surrounding 
it are fifty feet tall.  Armament crowds every available surface.  
Three towers rise high into the sky like the points of a crown.  
Truly this city has never been conquerqued.

Huge stalamites and other formations combine in a successful 
effort to create a wonderland.  The soft sound of dropping water 
sends echoes throughout the cavern and tunnels.

the cold water below. To the West, East, and South is Castle Reinhold's plaza.  
Because of the siege, the citizens are not allowed to set up a bazaar, 
but are allowed to wander around. 
After taking in the sites and smells of the Plaza, some of the 
citizens go East to visit the healer.

presently going on.

However, one of the civilians goats got loose and ate the herbs.  
It died shortly afterwards from missing it's herbs, but the loss 
of the garden still hits the Healer badly.

The Castle is very very close now.  It's shadow covers the 
cobblestone road you are now on.  The stench of blood fills your 
nostrils and you notice riverlets of it streaming down the 
cobblestone road.

You can hear the sounds of combat nearby.

Downward Slope~
At last.  Castle Reinhold shines with the light of GOODNESS.  
Below you, in the small valley before the gates of the castle, 
rests an army. A black standard flies from hundreds of spears 
and the dull beating of war drums fills the air.   
Death hangs over the valley and needs little help from the 
smoking ruins of civilian homes to darken the sun and spirits 
of Good warriors.

Battle Zone~
Without drawing the attention of the perimeter guards you have 
walked into the center of the dark camp. You notice for the first 
time the abscence of camp followers and of beast of burdon.   
How can an army exist without the comforts of their women...and 
what about food?   You saw that they left animal carcasses to rot 
in the sun.  

Hhhmmm.   You stop your contemplation when you notice a stew pot, 
hanging over a low fire.  You look inside. ***   GASP  ***    
Floating inside the pot are body parts of a small girl.  
You now realize that you are in the presence of pure evil.

You have made it into the castle.  Blood drips from your body onto the floor.

This ancient road has the oldest stonework in the city.  
The rest of the castle was built off this road, and you can tell by 
looking around that this is also the most defensive section of the city.
Ducal Guards are everywhere.  
You hear the ** CLANKING ** of their armor and of their boots.  
Somewhere to the West you hear the shrill screaming of woman and kids.

into a pig sty.  Trash and possessions are everywhere.   
Sanitation facilities are overrun.  Men and women, with children 
running rampant, have let their fear of the evil outside the walls 
to turn them into animals. The sight makes you sick to your stomach.

Large wooden barrels hold dozens of spears and arrows, while unstrung

Mercantile~
The building you are standing in has a quaint atmosphere about it.  
There are many adventuring items hanging from hooks and thrown on 
shelves.  A huge counter, piled high with odds and ends, attracts 
your attention.  You step up to the counter.

No exit blackness~
Doomed Doomed Doomed Doomed Doomed Doomed Doomed.

The river beats a rythem upon the rocks.  As the river hits the rocks 
it splashes towards the walls of the cavern, creating interesting 
designs and crevices.

Under the waterfall~
Under the waterfall is a beautiful cavern, glistening wet from the 
spray of the water.
You see a florescent moss growing on the walls of the cavern, 
illuminated a tunnel leading deeper into the mountain.
The floor of this cave has been many wet trails leading from the 
waterfall's pool to the tunnel before you.

a small dragon!

The Dark Abyss~
You are standing upon a tiny, 2 foot square piece of rock....  floating 
in the blackest abyss.  As you look around, you see the door and the rock 
you are standing on....and that is all.  The blackness is so complete it 
is oppressive.  The weight of the world beats down upon your head.
