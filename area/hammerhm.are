A Mountain Trail~
The mountain trail is well traveled and deeply worn, but it is difficult
going nonetheless.  A bitter north wind blasts down the trail, freezing
everything in sight.  The few other travelers on the trail are heavily clad
in furs and other winter garb.

A Mountain Trail~
The trail becomes narrower as the mountains become steeper.  Ice and
sleet make the footing slippery, and the cold wind makes the going even more
miserable.  The beauty of the mountains is stunning, with their snow-capped
and craggy peaks.  Unfortunately, the weather makes it impossible to enjoy.

Just over the horizon, you think you can see the gates to a city.  It
appears to be solidly made, with a sturdy wall around it to protect from
intruders.  Hopefully, it keeps out the elements, as well.

is noticeable, but with such solid gates they are really uneccesary.  There
is a very large keyhole in the gate.

Here inside the south gate of Hammerheim, the bitter cold and wind seem
less harsh.  The residents of this city, both male and female, are heavily
muscled and well-clad against the elements with heavy furs and solid winter
boots.  Most seem to carry at least a light weapon, as well.  This explains
the lack of guards at the gate.

Uraag's Road is a main thoroughfair of Hammerheim.  To the east, Holy Way
stretches out to the Cathedral.  The chanting of religious fanatics can be
heard even here.  The road itself is well-made with tightly fitting
cobblestones.  There is a loud clanging of metal on metal coming from the
road to the west of you.

The other traveleres on Uraag's Road are mostly the barbarian inhabitants

weapons they carry look menacing.  The cold is incredibly intense, and the
wind whips through your garments.  The faint sound of a hammer on an anvil

Hammerheim, the shrine is the home of the Overlord.  Her rule is absolute,
and her decisions are heavy-handed but just.  The shrine is also a quiet
place of worship for the masses, and also serves as an academy where people
can go to receive special training.

needy of Hammerheim is here.  Milling about are citizens of the town which
are deeply involved in their own thoughts.  Some seek an audience with the
Overlord.  Others wish to quietly worship their gods by providing for the
needy.  Still others seek the knowledge of the academics.

lavish for a barbarian.  The stout furniture in the room is covered with
very fine velvet, and the thick walls keep out the cold winds blowing

have scheduled an appointment.

the trainer, really knows how to provide a workout.  The thoroughness of her
teaching pays off, however.  At least it seems that way by the looks of
these barbarians.  The heat generated by the warm bodies makes this room one
of the most pleasent in Hammerheim.  The smell of the people working out

immense.  Tygaar, the wise scholar, could probably teach you a thing or two.

Groog's Way~
The people coming out from the shop to the north have sparkles in their
eyes, and sparkling jewelry on their bodies.  It must be the famous jewelry
shop of Hammerheim.  To the south, the clattering of silverware on plates
and the din of meal-time conversation can be heard.  The restaurant is
rumored to be among the best in the realm.

Groog's Way~
To the north of you stands a potions shop, which sells the necessary
extra protection an adventurer of your caliber may require to survive.  The
road continues east and west from here.

Before the West Tower~
Groog's Way ends at one of the lookout towers of Hammerheim.  Jutting out
from the stone wall, the tower provides a formidable defense for the city. 
It probably would not be a good idea to trespass here.  The barbarians are
very careful about their defenses and might not take kindly to an outsider
in their watch tower.

Inside the West Tower~
The inside of the western tower is very spartan in appearance.  Only a
large staircase winding up to the top of the tower can be seen.  The thick
granite walls provide a strong defense for the citizens of Hammerheim.  In
case of dire emergency, the entire population can run to the two lookout
towers to find safety and to help defend the city.

barbarians.  In times of war, this is very necessary.  All of the capable
men are employed in the city defenses during times of trouble, and the watch
towers provide the perfect position to defend the city.
