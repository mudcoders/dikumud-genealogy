3 'SHADOW DEMON' 'SHADOWDEMON' 'SHADOWLORD' 'SHADOW LORD' 'SHADE'~
The Shadowlord is merely a myth.  According to such myths, the Shadowlord
was the first creation from God.  After falling from grace, the Shadowlord
was cast to earth and died.  He supposed reincarnates about every 600-700
years.  When he does reincarnate, he creates minions called shadowdemons.
They, in turn, create minions, named shades.

artificial.  Also, just from the look of him you can bet that he has a night 
job as a bouncer.  You wonder if he's guarding something here.

3rd day of MIssion --
   It is incredible how much corruption is lurking underneath the seamingly
friendly place called 'Murky Land'.  Whoever design such a friendly front
for an illegal tavern frequent by murderers and thieves must be a genius.
I have yet seen what's behind the door next to the tavern.  I'm sure the
rooms there house more than just employees, considering the number of people
going in and out of that door.  In 3 days here, I've seen 8 human-shaped 
bundles hauled through that door already, and nothing coming out.  I need to
get my hands on that skeleton key!

4th day of Mission --
   I wonder if it's my nerves or what, but I keep thinking I am being 
watched and followed.  The shadows in this room seems to be moving, but
I'm sure it's merely the trick of the candlelight.  5 more bundles were
hauled through the employee door today, and I'm sure they are bodies or
victims.

XXXXX XXXXX"  And KXXXXX did die, and as He died, He bled onto the Earth.
But the blood of KhXXXX did not die, for it festered, and every XXXXX XXX,
it will XXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXX will be rebXXXXX.  He will then

This area has been made for any Merc/Envy Mud, by Hatchet, 8/20/1995, using
Slash's program, called Make Zones Fast.

This area has been created as a tribute to the original immortals of Merc and 
Envy.  Please don't just search and replace the names alluding to those 
immortals.  If you wish, feel free to add your own rooms and mobs to reflect 
your own immortals.

					    Sincerely,
