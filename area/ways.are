Waygate~
The walls of this chamber seem alive with colour and lights.  Images are
called to your memory by the patterns created as they swirl and glitter. 
You find yourself thinking of things long forgotten, and times before the
storm.  You start to see images of people long dead, and of battles fought
thousands of years before your time.  You realize that these chambers are
ancient, perhaps older than The Storm itself.  There is a small golden sign
on the wall here.

As you glance around the hallway you notice that although the light is
adequate, you can only see about ten feet around you.  There doesn't seem to
be a fading of light, but rather an absence of it.  You note this as merely
an annoyance until you realize that ten feet is an awfully short distance
for a creature to close in at.  You realize that you'll have no quick notice
as to what is about to attack you.  The place fairly reeks of fear.

not tired in any way. If you were to approach one of the walls and touch it,
you would find that it feels fuzzy and the shape is all wrong. After a while
your stomach starts to protest your scrutiny of the walls, so you are forced
to avert your eyes.

legs protruding from a pustule and infected back.  This place is a true

Hallway of the Dragon~
The hallway continues to the west and the northern wall harbors an
entrance way.  You can smell a foul stench radiating from the north.  The
area around the door seems to slowly fade from stone to a sort of milky
white substance as it curves into the large oval room.  You can sense the
presence of some huge beast through that passageway.

An oval chamber~
The chamber is oval in shape, and it is most awkward to stand on the
floor.  The walls are fashioned of some strange milky white substance and
colours seem to play across its surface.  You mentally liken it to watching
a rainbow through milky lenses.  The overall affect is quite stunning.

Hallway of the Dragon~
You note that there is no actual corner to this bend in the hallway, it's
just that, a bend.  The hallway seems to have been drawn to the south slowly
and the hall curves and contorts to compensate.  The portraits hanging along
the curved wall are also curved, as are the torches and the flames they
produce.  The overall affect is quite disconcerting, especially when you
notice that you begin to curve as well.

The hallway broadens here until you could fit five or six stalwart
dwarves shoulder to shoulder across it.  You can sense tiny vibrations
through the floor as if some massive machine is operating off in the
distance.  You note that the walls here seem to glow with a light of their
own, and even give off a small amount of heat.

Hallway of the Dragon~
The walls of the hallway seem to pulse slowly, as if breathing.  You
slowly run your hands across its surface before realizing that they are not
pulsing with life, but with some kind of vibration.  You can feel the
presence of some powerful entity lurking just beyond your sight.

Once again the hallway bends slowly to the west.  The curvature is
amazingly accurate and you note that all the portraits and tapestries are
curved to fit their position on the wall.  As you navigate the curve you
feel your stomach wrench in contept as your body itself starts to conform to
the hall's curvature.

far to the south, and it is from that direction that the vibrations seem to
be strongest.  Over the low hum you can make out the sound of claws grating
on brick, and the low rumble of some huge beasts growl.

Chamber of the Prism~
This chamber seems to have been carved from a huge multi-faceted crystal.
Lights refract across its surface creating a highly hypnotic pattern.  You
watch blithly until you can feel your mind slowly slipping away.  You shake
yourself back into realization with a new respect for this place.  Surely it
is the purpose of this chamber to distract the undisciplined adventurer. 
The whole chamber seems to be vibrating in resonance to some sound you
cannot hear.

This room is set apart from the rest in The Ways.. in the fact that it
seems normal.  You would almost think this to be a simple chamber in any
castle within The Storm.  The walls are made of good hard granite and
torches light the chamber with a flickering glow.  The rug is plush and well
woven and there are several portraits of warriors and magi on the walls. 
You are about to leave when you notice a faint glow coming from the east
wall...

make out the sounds of voices with each throb.  They call to you
tantalizing, seducing....  You slowly snap back to reality and shake off the
web that had been slowly falling over your mind.  You realize that you will

This room seems strangely familiar to you, as if you had briefly passed
it by at some point or another.  There are no overly distinguishing
qualities to it, the walls are all fine granite stone, and the floor is very
nearly buried in plush rugs and furs.  The portraits on the walls show
strange beings walking amongst groups of mortals which seem to be totally
ignorant of their existance.

creatures abound on the Ancient Level of this strange place.

you can feel your other senses begin to heighten. Your eyes bulge forward,

eager anticipation. You can sense the presence of something unnatural further

polished to a shine. You deftly run your hand along one of the walls and you
pull it back, bleeding. Looking upon the wall, you notice a spike slowly
returning to its hiding place. There is a set of gallows here, and it drips
with fresh blood. Upon closer examination though, it is gone. An illusion,
perhaps? The room seems to be emulating with the fears of it's occupants.
Very odd, indeed.

Corridor of Gates~
There is an iron bound door to the west.  You can hear eight distinct
growls coming from behind the door, yet you hear only one creature moving
about.  You wonder briefly as to what make of creature this must be. 
Whatever it is, you doubt it will be friendly.

Chamber of the Goblet~
This room is enormous, its ceiling being well over thirty feet above. 
The floor is damp and the air smells stale and fetid.  You look down and see
the bones of past travelers littering the room.  Most are cracked or
entirely destroyed.  Under the decay you can make out a faint hint of sulfur
and the rank smell of feces.

Corridor of Gates~
You come abruptly to the end of the passageway.  There is a large black
door directly to the east, and you can hear the sounds of flapping coming
from within.  Taking a quick look around you notice that the pictures in
this portion of the halls are hung upside down.

Chamber of the Tablet~
Upon entering this chamber your nostrils are assailed with the rank smell
of feces and other bodily excretions.  You feel your stomach begin to turn
and consciously fend off an urge to relinquish your last reprise.  The room
itself seems to be in good shape, other than the inch deep scratches in the
floor.

A crumbling waygate~
The waygate is crumbling and in bad repair.  Mortar falls from the walls
and ceiling making it difficult to walk.  You wonder how the place is still
even standing, it is such a mess.

Decaying Hallway~
You are walking down a decaying hallway.  The walls are in poor repair
with mortar and stones falling from them and leaving piles of rubble on the
ground.  The ceiling is pocked and crumbling about you.  You get the feeling
that this is not the safest place in the world to be.

Decaying Hallway~
You are in a decaying hallway.  It looks like this place has never been
cared for.  Holes in the walls and ceiling are abundant and the floor is
covered with mortar and splintered wood.  Looking around you, you can never
be fully sure the hall will not collapse about you.

Mortar and stone crumble to the ground.  The walls are crumbling and not
very safe looking.  Overhead the ceiling is pock marked and stained.  You
get the feeling no one has been down this hall in a very long time.

Decaying Hallway~
You are forced to carefully pick your way through the rubble on the
ground that at one time was the walls and ceiling of the hall.  A shiver
goes up your spine as yet another piece of the ceiling falls not 3 inches
from your head.

Chamber of Decay~
As you enter the chamber you are overwhelmed with the general disrepair of
the whole place.  Every available surface is cracked and filled with holes. 
Piles of mortar cover the floor and pieces of the ceiling continue to fall
around you.  The floor is made from black flagstones but not one flagstone
is whole.  Looking around you, a shiver runs up your spine as you wonder
whether it is safe to be here.
