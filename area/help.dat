        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

&WRESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example, if you are equipping a mobile, don't load a container in the 
room and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the mobile.
It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

Brought to you by the Directors of EnvyMud (Kahn, Hatchet & Kith)
and we reserve the right to modify these guidelines at any point in time
or to render them null and void.
~
-1 ACCEPT~
Type accept when a player is challenging someone to fight in the arena.
You cannot accept a challenge while in hell or jail, or fighting. 
If you have the required amount of coins being challenged, you will both
be transported to the arena.

See also: ARENA CHALLENGE
~
-1 SCRY~
Scry is a spell which once cast, allows you to see into rooms directly
around you.  Type cast 'scry' to use. Once casted, if you type look
north, then it will look into the room to the north and show you that room,
who's in it, and what objects are in it.
~
-1 SCHOOL~
Mud School was designed by Hatchet of MERC Industries for any MERC mud.

The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the
game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.
~
0 !~
&RSyntax:&B &w!

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
&RSyntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>&w

&BBUY&w buys an object from a shop keeper.

&BLIST&w with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
&BLIST&w <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

&BSELL&w sells an object to a shop keeper.

&BVALUE&w asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

&BBUY&w, &BSELL&w, and &BVALUE&w, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if &BLIST DAGGER&w showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~
0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells and SING for bards.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set, you
will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

COINS being one of gold, silver or copper.
DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt 
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (worn armor, weapons, and held items)
INVENTORY lists your visible inventory/what you are carrying
~
0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KICK KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.
You must also MURDER followers/charmed mobiles.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice the
appropriate skill.
~
0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~
0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake  <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly. Your class and race may also affect the "wearability" of
any item or piece of equipment.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~
50 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all of the immortal commands available to you.
~
0 AREAS COMMANDS SOCIALS~

Syntax: socials
Syntax: area <level#>

AREAS shows you all of the areas in the game, with the author's name and the
suggested levels.

verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

0 DEATH~
&WPlease read this, and keep all in mind. For short version see "help death2".&w
When your character dies, you are reincarnated persay. This is, of course,
depending on the level of your character at the time of death.
 
If you die AT or UNDER LEVEL 20, you and your corpse will be transferred to
the morgue. Here you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. You will then have to ENTER
<your portal of choice>. If you are GOOD ALIGNED, you will want to ENTER
BETHAVEN. If you are EVIL ALIGNED, you will most likely choose to ENTER
RAVENWOOD, as it is well-known for its shadowy places. NEUTRAL characters
are welcomed in either of the towns. Of course, you may go to Ravenwood if
you are good aligned, but you will surely pay the price.
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 at the time of death, you will be sent to the morgue.
That is, your mind and soul will be transferred to the morgue where it will
have to seek out and find your body to join with once again. Of course, if
you have no luck in finding your corpse you will have to re-equip yourself
with no armour to aid you.
 
The Gods have been known to grant favors for mortals who are reknown for great
deed-doing (helping newbies, and helping others retrieve lost corpses). To
expect such a favor is sacriledge, and to receive one... a great honor.
 
** Any affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.**
**Followers and group members are not affected by death**
**You lose experience points for dying. You lose half-way back to the
  beginning of your level.**
**All followers are lost upon your death. (or theirs)**
&R***&WCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last -roughly- 30 hours of MUD time (15 minutes real time). Only
the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects from a
player's corpse.&R***&w
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    killing monsters
    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
-1 STORY~
One hundred and fifty years ago ...

Nomads from the Great Eastern desert brought spices and slaves to the Thalos
Market.  Dwarven miners, rough and rude, sold precious stones and drank the
town dry of firebreathers.  Stone golems, created by mages from the Tower of
High Sorcery, stood sentry duty in the watch towers.

It was dawn on the Day of Thunder.  The Mayor of Midgaard (great-grand-father
of today's Mayor) arrived early to pay tribute at City Hall.  He entered the
Grand Gate unchallenged.  He found the streets and markets empty.  Seeing a
nearby lamia, he asked her about the residents.  Where were all the people?

The lamia didn't act like a lamia.  Instead of answering him in the helpful but
stupid lamia manner, she stabbed the Mayor with a long, slim dagger.  Other
lamias, hearing the tumult, arrived and attacked.  The Mayor was killed.

Now Thalos is abandoned.  Wild lamias roam the streets, killing intruders and
sacrificing their bodies at the Temple of Thalos.  The golems no longer respond
to command and now watch eternally from their ruined towers.

Midgaard is next.
~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

When an area resets, you are often notified with what is called the "area
sound". Usually some theme to the area. Again, some areas have no sound and
you will not be physically warned of a reset.
~
0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
~
0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well as
a comparison of your relative health. Of course, it's only a rough estimate
and your opponents shields are usually not considered in this comparison.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~
0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: auction  <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~
0 EMOTE , SOCIALS~

~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

Also see BASH for warriors.
~
0 DRINK~
&BSyntax: &Wdrink <object>
 
Drinking is very &Pimportant &Win this game, if you do not perhaps
you might die of &Pdehydration&W.  Remember always keep you fluids
up!
 
~
0 SACRIFICE~
&BSyntax: &Wsacrifice <object>
 
SACRIFICE offers an object to your God.  God may &Preward &Wyou for the 
sacrifice.  The nature of the reward &Pdepends &Wupon the type of object.
&RHint:&W God likes corpses.
 
~
0 FLEE~
&BSyntax: &Wflee
 
Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can &Pattempt&W to FLEE.  All this means is that instead
of fighting, you turn tail and haul ass.  Flee &Pdoes not always work&W and you
will lose experience for succeeding or failing for showing such cowardice.
 
~
0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
&BSyntax:&W bash <direction>
 
A powerful warrior can attempt to &Pbypass&W the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly &Paggressive&W action, and
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
 
~
0 CHAMELEON 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
&BSyntax: &Wchameleon
 
With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to &Pchange&W
the appearance and coloration of his or her body, armor, and equipment to
blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective if the
psionicist remains &Pabsolutely still&W.
 
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~
&BSyntax: &Wfollow <character>
&BSyntax: &Wgroup
&BSyntax: &Wgroup <character>
 
FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.
 
GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.
 
If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
 
GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
&RNOTE:&W You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
 
~
0 HEIGHTEN 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
&BSyntax: &Wheighten
 
A psionicist is able to heighten there senses some times.  When they do this, 
they have the ability to &Pdetect&W things that would otherwise go unnoticed.  
So in other words, they become more &Palert&W, etc.
 
~
0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
&BSyntax: &WHIDE
&BSyntax: &WSNEAK
&BSyntax: &WVISIBLE
 
The skill hide, is used by a lot of thieves.  Many times they have to &Phide&W
when a storekeeper (or someone else they robbed), is chasing after them
calling for the police.  If done properly most people &Pcannot see you&W.
 
Sometimes you must also try to sneak out of a room when &Phiding&W.  If you
sneak &Pproperly&W, most people will not be able to see you and hear you when
you leave.
 
If you must become &Pvisible&W again, type visible and it &Pcancels&W you hiding and
sneaking. It also cancels almost any invisibility routine.
 
~
0 'POISON WEAPON'~
&BSyntax: &Wpoison <weapon>
 
With this skill, a thief can create a &Pdeadly&W poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires &Pspecial ingredients&W, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.
 
&RCaution:&W The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.
 
~
0 PRACTICE~
&BSyntax: &WPRACTICE
&BSyntax: &WPRACTICE <skill|spell>
 
PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 
100%, depending on your class.  You must be at a &PGUILDMASTER &Wto 
practice.
 
The higher your &Pintelligence&W, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your &Pwisdom&W, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
&BSyntax:&W QUIT
&BSyntax:&W SAVE
 
SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save. The game will &Pauto-save&W your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.
 
&RNOTE: &WSome objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, 
may not be saved.
 
 
QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere. When you return to the
game, you will find yourself in the room you last quit in.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can &Psafely &Wleave the game with just one
command. Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to &Pregret &Wit
 
&RNOTE: &WThere is no RENT on this MUD.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you 
want to leave.
 
~
0 RECALL 'RECITE RECALL'~
Syntax: RECALL
Syntax: RECITE RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
your Temple. RECITE RECALL works only when you have a scroll of recall,
and you must have practiced the appropriate skill for scrolls.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse will not recall at all.
~
0 SHADOW 'SHADOW FORM'~
Syntax: shadow

A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows while 
moving, having the same effect as the thief skill SNEAK.  See also VISIBLE.
~
0 SPELLS~
Syntax: spells

This command shows the spell caster how much mana each spell he or she knows
will cost.

For a list of ALL available spells for your class, type SLIST.
~
0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.
~
0 STEAL~
&BSyntax:&W STEAL coins    <character>
&BSyntax:&W STEAL <object> <character>
 
Steal is the one skill that &Pdefines&W a person as a thief.  If you are
a thief most of your life revolves around this skill.  Thieves would
much rather &Ptake&W something from someone else, rather than earn it.
But what can you say?  They are thieves.
 
&RBeware: &WThere are penalties for using steal on other players.
~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'move'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana points, and movement points.  Each
of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable gain.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~
0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~
54 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
54 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, etc.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
53 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~
52 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock
Syntax: numlock <number>

to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who
lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.
Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NEWLOCK is a shortcut to NUMLOCK 1.  NEWLOCK will turn on numlock but
not turn off if currently set.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

~
0 TRAINER~
TRAINERs can provide extensive training sessions which enable players
to TRAIN their base statistics.
~
-1 WAR WARRIOR~
The WARRIOR class is the most basic fighting class available.  Their
battle training along with high strength and high hit points make them
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  WARRIORs train in the art of
multiple attacks.  Some master the art of a SECOND ATTACK and if experienced
enough, master a THIRD ATTACK.  Along with this training in multiple
attacks, a WARRIOR is trained in making each hit count.  ENHANCED DAMAGE
is available to only the learned.  Toward the defense side of the WARRIOR,
skills of PARRY, RESCUE and BASH DOOR allow the WARRIOR to ward off attacks,
rush to the aid of fellow comrades, and open doors rather barbarically.
~
-1 CLE CLERIC~
The CLERIC class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward
defense.  A deity gives the CLERIC spells in the curing, warding, and
protection divinities.  CLERICs being of a defensive nature fare poorly
in the art of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servants to
society or doctors to their comrades in arms.
~
-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
The MAGE class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the MAGE taps
into to influence the world.  MAGE spells are devoted to the invoking,
hermetic, and combative nature.  MAGEs fare a little better than their
CLERIC counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer to
stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL.
~
-1 THI THIEF~
The THIEF class can be characterized as a WARRIOR who dropped out of school
to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wirey persons have
physical endurance slightly less than that of a WARRIOR but are much more
agile.  Whereas a WARRIOR uses well placed weapon slashes, a THIEF seeks to
DISARM his opponent.  THIEVES also excel in the art of stealth.
An unwary opponent might not detect a THIEF until a BACKSTAB is attempted.
To achieve success in this, the skills SNEAK and HIDE are learned.  With
a THIEF's PICK LOCK and POISON WEAPON skill, a THIEF also makes the perfect
assassin for political powerhouses.
~
-1 PSI PSIONISIST~
The PSIONISIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionisist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionisist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionisist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionisist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
~
0 GHOST~
When traveling in the night, beware of GHOSTS.  Fortunately, sunlight is
a bane for these representatives of the dead.
~
0 'ADRENALINE CONTROL'~
Syntax: cast 'adrenaline control' 

By controlling the production and release of adrenaline in his or her system, 
the psionicist can gain temporary boosts in dexterity and constitution.  This 
control cannot be initiated during battle because, hey, even psionicists get a 
little excited from time to time.
~
0 AGITATION~
Syntax: cast 'agitation' <character>

This skill is nearly identical to the Mage spell BURNING HANDS.  With this 
skill, a psionicist can cause the cells in his or her victim to become
agitated, moving so fast as to cause burn damage.
~
0 AWE~
Syntax: cast 'awe' <character>

With this discipline, a skilled psionicist can use the power of his or
her mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy
will be overcome by awe for the psionicist, and will simply forget to
fight.  Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature
after only a brief lull in the action.
~
0 'BALLISTIC ATTACK'~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <character>

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to throw 
small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in the area,
at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the psionicist, and
painful to the victim.
~
0 'BIOFEEDBACK'~
Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of blood 
through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to reduce
bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively reducing
the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
~
0 'CELL ADJUSTMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'

A skilled psionicist can also perform CELL ADJUSTMENT, which can remove both 
curses and poisons from his or her body.
~
0 'COMBAT MIND'~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her 
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an 
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize the 
damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathinc, this 
knowledge can also be shared with the his or her companions.
~
0 'CONTROL FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'control flames' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can will the flames in his or her light source to
leap out and strike an enemy.  And if you don't think your light source uses a 
flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close enough.
~
0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.
~
0 'DETONATE'  'DISINTEGRATE'~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <character>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <character>

With both of these skills, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the 
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to 
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most 
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to be 
SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists can DETONATE 
objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists can even
DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~
0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'
  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast 'displacement'
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an 
armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other 
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the damage 
infliced by creatures of negative energy.
~
0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended 
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~
0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or 
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of 
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~
0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy 
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~
0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects, 
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.
~
0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' 'ULTRABLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <character>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <character>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <character>
Syntax: cast 'ultrablast'    <character>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the neural 
synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in increasing order of
damage inflicted.
~
0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~
0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <character>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind will 
strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~
0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~
0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of EOS **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)
~
-1 RULES~
These are the rules of EOS.  For other matters, use commom sense.

* foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on EoS, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.

* sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion

* your presence here is a privilige not a right
 
* no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
  You risk deletion should you be caught.
 
* Absolutely NO summonsing any mobs to Bethaven or Ravenwood.  I do NOT
   wish newbies jeopardized.  There's plenty of room outside those towns,
   use them.

-1 STORY~
In the beginning, the earth was... oh too far back.
*crumbles up help file and throws it away*
~
0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
51 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The spells command is used to display your character's list of available
skills and spells.  Slist will also show you all skills and spells available
to your character.  Skills and spells are listed showing amount of pts
(points) it costs for each particular one, when you type spells.  
~
0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist), typing it again removes
it. 
~
-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
101 HEDIT~
Command:
% hedit <name>
% hedit create <name>
asave 0 to save help files
~
105 ARGLIST~
The mobprog arglist changes from type to type.
For most types it is a percentage (1-100), and on others it is keywords
or an ammount.
I.e., for the hit_prcnt_prog, it's a percentage.. namely if the arglist is 30,
then when the mobs hp is at 30% or less of max, then the prog is triggered.
For give_prog, the arglist is all the keywords of the object to trigger that program
when the object is given to the mob.
And for all_greet_prog, arglist is a percentage, 100 will make the prog run
whenever anyone enters the room (excluding invis imms).
~
105 INEWS~
Numerous commands have been added.
Note:  vused
       wrlist
       mpedit
       hedit
       restrict
~
106 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict [commandname] [level]
Syntax: restrict [commandname] log [logtype]
 
Commandname is the name of the command you wish to change the level or
logtype of, you can use shortforms of commands giving there aren't any
other commands with those sames letters or you may not get the one you
wish. :)  Logtype is the type of logging you wish a command to have,
type restrict by itself for quick syntax and the logtypes.  Also,
it is possible to type:  restrict all [firstcmd#] [secondcmd#]
for a listing of commands and the levels which they are currently at.
Firstcmd# is the first command you wish to list from, and secondcmd#
is the number of the command you wish to list to.
~
101 WRLIST~
Syntax: wrlist [type(r/o/m/p)] [lvnum] [uvnum]
 
Wrlist lists the vnums and names of the items in those vnums.  You can list
room vnums and their names with r, objects with o, and mobs with m.  When
listing rooms, it also shows you the resets in each room.  Lvnum is the
beginning vnum you wish to list from, and uvnum is the ending vnum.
Note, with m, if the mob has mobprogs, it will list each of the
different types of mobprogs the mob has.  P will list all the mobs with
mobprogs within the range.  It will show the full mobprog: type, arglist,
AND comlist, unlike with m.
 
When checking for progs (p) using wrlist, please only use a maximum vnum
range of about 25 at a time, or the Mud will crash due to spamming.
~
106 VUSED~
Vused simply lists all the blocks of vnums which have been created to date.
The last line it shows tells you just how many free vnums there are. :)
~
105 VARIABLES~
Here is a list of variables that can possibly be used in most mobprog commands
, etc.
 $i   the name of the mob being triggered
 $I   the mobs short description
 $n   the name of the mob/pc triggering the mobprog
 $N   the short description of the person triggering the mobprog if it
      is a mob, or the name of the trigger person plus their title if it
      is a pc
 $t   the name of the victim
 $T   the same as $N except for the victim
 $r   the name of a pc/npc taken from random in the room
 $R   the same as $N except the random person is used
 $e   returns he/she/it according to the sex of the trigger person
 $m   returns him/her/it according to the sex of the trigger person

elves can tap into the very source of their magical energy, allowing them to

creatures can sneak up behind you without you even noticing, a trait these
creatures have learned in order to survive would-be attackers.  Prefering to
hide away in their homes and stay out of sight or contact with any other
races while abroad, halflings generally don't accumulate the level of wisdom
found in the rest of the lands' races.

0 CAST CASTING SPELL~
For all spell casting classes, once you reach a certain level, you recieve 
spells which you may practice, and then cast.  There are spells devoted to
protection, attack, healing, and one or two other miscellaneous subject
areas.  To be able to cast a spell, it must be practiced to at least 1% or
higher, otherwise you will eternally lose concentration.  Spell casting costs
vampires blood points, and with all other spell casting classes it costs mana.
How much mana or how many blood points it takes, is mainly dependant on what
kind of spell it is and how many levels you have been able to practice it.  As
you gain levels, spells that you had on previous levels will drop in mana/bp
cost.  To see how much mana/bp your currently practiced spells will
cost to cast, you may type SPELLS.  Typing PRACTICE will list all currently
practiced spells and skills.  Also, to see all the spells and skills that
your class will recieve, type SLIST.

game driver will replace what you typed with the string found in [new].

105 PARAMTYPES PTYPES~
All x_progs are triggered by certain actions, and then are passed through
a check to see if the trigger is activated.  There are various types
of parameters based on these checks, which are compared to the information
received by the game driver.
 
Percent Parameters:
  These are the most common kind of checks.  The parameter is a number
between 0 and 100, 0 meaning the trigger will never activate, and 100
meaning the trigger will activated every time it is called.
 
Word Parameters:
  These parameters may be specified in one of two ways: As a word list or
as a phrase.  As a word list, each word of the parameter is check against
each word of the incoming data, and if any of the words match, the trigger
will be activated.  A phrase parameter starts off with the letter 'p' as
the first word, followed by the phrase to be compared.  In a phrase, all
words compared much match (excluding the initial 'p').
 
Slot Parameters:
  These indicate a spell slot.  Spell slots may be found by using the
'slookup' command.  Be careful to use the SLOT and not the SN, as they
are two different numbers, used for different purposes.
 
Hour Parameters:
  This type takes two arguments: The starting hour and the finishing
hour.  These are called every game hour, and if the time is between the
two numbers, the trigger will activate.  Numbers must be in 24 hour format,
and may wrap around midnight.  (ie: '20 8' would activate every hour between
8:00pm and 8:00am, game time, every game night.)
 
Hitpoints Parameters:
  The parameters for this trigger is a number between 0 and 100, indicating
the percentage of hitpoints the mob has from its max hitpoints.  The trigger
is activated when the mobile's hitpoints to max hitpoints percentage fall
below the specified percentage.
 
Itemlist Parameters:
  This is a list of items which may activate the trigger.  Use quotation
marks (' or ") if you wish to use items with more than one keyword.
eg: 'orange dagger' as opposed to orange dagger.  The first example would
need an item with both names to activate the trigger, and the second
example would need an item with either name to activate.
 
Goldpieces Parameters:
  The ammount specified in the single parameter is the minimum ammount
of gold needed to activate the trigger.
~
101 MVARS MVARIABLES~
All mob_progs may use the following variables:
  $i, $n, $r, and modifications of these (like $e for $n)
 
prog name      | param type | useable variables
---------------+------------+------------------
act_prog       | word       | see below
speech_prog    | word       | (none)
rand_prog      | percent    | (none)
fight_prog     | percent    | (none)
death_prog     | percent    | (none)
hitprcnt_prog  | hitpoints  | (none)
entry_prog     | percent    | (none)
greet_prog     | percent    | (none)
all_greet_prog | percent    | (none)
give_prog      | itemlist   | $o
bribe_prog     | goldpieces | (none)
 
Note: rand_prog and entry_prog do *NOT* have a $n variable available.
 
For act_prog, the variables depend on the information received
Any action that involves an object may use $o.
Any action that involves two or more objects may use $o and $p.
Any action that involves a third party may use $t.
These actions do not have to be done by the programmed mobile.
ie: A person types 'give <object> <target>'.  $o becomes <object>, and
$t becomes <target>.  $t may be the same as $i if the mobile itself is
the target of the action.

1 BUILDING~
Eye of the Storm II perfers to have new and UNIQUE zones.  If the zone
is on anothermud please do not submit it here.  When you create an area for
use with EOSII, you give to the admin of the mud and those assigned by them
the right to use it and modify it on a permanent basis, because of the large
effort required by us to help you build the zone.  We retain the right to
use (or not use) any area submitted to us.  Once a zone is submitted and it
is linked into the mud the author of the zone gives up any rights to remove
the zone from the mud.  We will not give your area away without doing
everything in our power to ask your permission first and we kindly ask that
you do the same for us.  
 
If you feel you are qualified to build for us please speak to
Grunt, who is head of building here.
(Previous building experience is highly recommended)
~
1 NEWBIE~
To the absolute beginner:
 
Welcome to The Storm.  The Storm is a multi user Dungeon game or Mud for
short.  If you have gotten this far you have already chosen your race and
class.  Those choices you have made have created the character you are now
controlling.  You can make your character do almost anything by using a command
and pressing enter.  If your screen scrolls while you are typing just continue
to enter your command the mud will understand you.
 
 
Some commands to get you going are as follows:
   >look           and also 'look in <item>'
   >say            followed by the sentence you wish to say
   >who will show all visible players.
   >tell <person> and what you want to tell a person.
   >chat and what you want the world to hear.
   >exits          will reveal all obvious exits from the room you are in
   >north          will take you to the north if you can go there
   >south          -------------------- south -------------------
   >east           -------------------- east  -------------------
   >up             --------------------  up   -------------------
   >down           -------------------- down  -------------------
   >inventory      lists the items you carry
   >equipment      lists the items you are using
   >get <item>     to pick up an item
   >score          gives you your current score.
   >save saves your char and equipment.
   >quit  quits the game.
 
All commands can be abbreviated.  Thus the command 'look' can be abbreviated to
just 'l'.  Names of things and items can NOT be abbreviated, you must write
their full name to refer to them.  Be careful! Learn which abbreviations trigger
which commands.  For instance, 's' is an abbreviation for 'south' not 'say' and
sc is an abbreviation for score.
If you want to know more commands try just typing "help" by its self on a
line and press enter.  Also to find out more about commands try typing the
word "help" followed by the command for example try:
  help look
  help autoexits
For the extreem newbie and even the seasoned mudders we suggest you go through
mud school to learn how all the commands work.  In mud school you can do
everything from make your first few levels to buying a few needed items for
adventuring.
If you get stuck feel free to ask questions on the chat channel or check the
who list for a god with "Mortal Council" in their title.  Please try not to
bother other gods as they are usually very busy trying to add  to the world.
  From all the gods here at Storm we hope you have fun and wish your
  character luck as it runs into anything and everything.

Pet Shops are one of the more tricky aspects of building, because a pet
shop requires 2 rooms in order to function correctly.  The first room is
where the person goes to buy their pet.  The second room is where the mobs
for sale are reset to.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that the second room be
the VERY NEXT VNUM after the first.  (Thus if the pet shop is room 1234,
then the second room where the pets are stored should be 1235) 
Room1: Gets the pet_shop flag. No mob is necessary but one just standing there
       pretending to be a shopkeeper adds to the reality. The mob is not a 
       shopkeeper, the room itself is the shopkeeper.
Room2: This is where you reset the mobs for sale. the mobs must have the flag
       'Pet' toggled under the act section. Prices are set by mob level.

101 INVOKE~
Ok builders,.... here's the info you all have been waiting for.
 
While in oedit, you have the possibility to do 5 things with INVOKE.
These are set by the ac_type command.  (See help AC_TYPE)  The most 
common of these is ac_type 5, which is for casting spells. Once you set the
ac_type, you then must fill in any other information required.  For casting a
spell, you must provide a spell (help ac_setspell) and a current and maximum
charge level (help ac_v1, and ac_v2).  To change an object from the current
one to another, you must provide a second object the current one will 
transform to (help ac_vnum).  Here's a sample for invoking invis:
 
ac_type 5
ac_setspell invisibility
ac_v1 5

~

Werewolves being animals, the adore fighting with their claws.  At an
early period in their lives, the develop a better fighting style with only
the use of their claws.  Enhanced claws is the skill in which a werewolf
learns how to better wound his opponent when fighting bare handed.  (If you
can call razor sharp claws bare hand, that is...)  
~

&wUse &RPERMBAN&w, &RTEMPBAN&w, &RNEWBAN&w & &RALLOW&w without arguments to see the syntax
of these commands.
~
1 'ENHANCED CLAWS'~
This skill increases the damage a werewolf's claws do in combat.  The use of
this skill is automatic once practiced, but only works while the werewolf is
using his claws.  It will not give a werewolf any extra damage while the
werewolf is using conventional weapons.
~
1 'HOWL OF FEAR'~
Syntax: howl <target>
&w
Faced with the bellowing howl of rage from a werewolf's towering form, most
enemies will be stricken by a sudden overwhelming feeling of fear and paralysis.
Victims effected by a werewolf's beastly howl are generally disheartened and
therefor inflict less damage with each hit and find themselves too afraid to
press their oppenent making their hits landed fewer.
~
1 'ENHANCED REFLEXES'~
Syntax: enhance
Note  : This spell is the skill equivalent of 'haste' and is not accumulative
        with it.
&w
The art of fluid movement, trained by thieves and natural to werewolves, is
displayed through either of these graceful opponent's specialized reflexes.  By
concentrating on your objective and making yourself feel one with it these
groups of men, women and beasts are able to hone their skills and speed into a
near dance of gracefully dealt death allowing them to land blows faster than the
eye can keep up with.
~
1 'DUAL CLAWS'~
After gaining a certain amount of experience in the art of barehanded fighting
werewolves give up some of their defensive forms to learn the tactics of
attacking with both claws.  For them to be allowed this freedom of movement they
must not use a shield or hold any items, freeing their hands and arms enough to
allow quick movement.  This skill once learned is automatic in function and
works similar to 'dual wield', but does not require a second weapon to be used.
~
1 'RAKE EYES'~
&wSyntax: &Wrake <target>
&w
Sensing an opening in your defenses a trained werewolf will quickly
press his or her advantage by taking a swift and savage strike at your
eyes, gouging them with their sharp claws.  This attack will almost
always leave an opponent blind and wishing he'd paid closer attention,
but is not accumulative, due to it's damaging nature.
~
1 'DOUBLE BACKSTAB'~
A true master of the thieving arts might learn the skill of striking with not
one, but two backstabs.  Requiring the agility known only to a select few of the
world's adventurers, this ability demands a high mastery in the art of stealth
to slip behind someone and take them by surprise enough to land more than the
first backside blow.  Although while it has many advantages, this does leave a
thief's striking range rather short, since to strike multiple blows he must use
both hands with daggers ready.
~
102 DEMM_102~

101 DEMM_101~
&RThe world twist and spirles in.  Power drains away from you leaving you
empty.  A meager spark remains from the power you once had.

&BWhile mortals are the lifeblood of a MUD, immortals are the guiding force
directing it in the right direction, but how each immortal (imm) acts in
their job varies greatly.  Thalador have been receiving a GREAT
many notes upon subjects they either shouldn't have to or don't have time

can see.  This is our 'chain of command', please use and respect it.
Thank you for your time & effort into making this MUD what it is today.
~
106 IMM TOYS~
An Imm Toy is any item created by an Imm with illegal stats on it.
Illegal stats meaning something that would NOT be allowed in game.
Imm Toys cause more crashes and headaches around here, and that leads
to pissing me off, and you really don't want to do that.  Imm Toys are NOT
allowed, and if you've created any, delete them NOW!  There's enough 
Imm crap in game as it is.
~
1 AUTOQUEST~
&W Autoquesting is for every level and there are certain rules and
commands to know about.  &W You have to be at a Quest Master mob to use most
the available commands.  
&W
&wQUEST INFO:&W This will tell you what you are currently questing for.
&wQUEST TIME:&W Displays the amount of time you have left to complete your current
&W            quest or the amount of time until you can quest again if you just
&W            quested.
&wQUEST POINTS:&W This will tell you the amount of quest points you have so far.
&wQUEST REQUEST:&W This allows you to -request- an autoquest. The &cQuest Master&W
&W               will then see if it has a quest to give you.
&wQUEST COMPLETE:&W Once you've completed a quest, return to the &cQuest Master&W
&W                who assigned you the quest, and type QUEST COMPLETE.
&wQUEST LIST:&W This lists the available items you can buy with your quest points. 
&W            You must be at a &cQuest Master&W to list or buy items also.
&wQUEST BUY:&W To buy an item type QUEST BUY <item>.
&wQUEST AREA:&W When you are assigned a quest, you may type QUEST AREA to see what
&W            area your quest is in.
&W
 
&WAutoquests are random, and chosen suitable to your level. Sometimes you will
&Wget a quest to kill a mob, or a quest to find an object. If you are assigned an
&Wobject quest, the object is placed in the room of a suitable mob according to 
&Wyour level. You must go get the object and return to the &cQuest Master&W and
&Wtype QUEST COMPLETE.  He will then take the object from you and reward you with
&Wquest points.
 
&WIf you are assigned a mob quest, you must go find the mob and kill it, then 
&Wreturn to the &cQuest Master&W and type QUEST COMPLETE.  The mob you are to kill
&Wwill have a [TARGET] flag and while you are questing you will have a [QUESTING]

often found guarding various treasures throughout the realms of the land.
Born with massive strength and amazing stamina, these noble beasts can often
live centuries before passing on with only their slow movement, due to their
massive bulk, hindering them.  Using the dual horns of their head they can
often temporarily paralyse an enemy with one mighty slam of their head.

&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of evil sight'
Often having to travel from village to village entertaining in the local
inns and taverns, bards have learned to spot those of evil nature through

a bard's pouch of gold.
~
0 'SONG OF ICY TOUCH'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of icy touch' <victim>

0 DROW FIRE~
&Wsyntax:&w df <victim>

0 'ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE'~
&wAfter spending years training in the martial arts, many monks further enhance
their studies in hand-to-hand combat learning the makeup of the human body.
This teaches them were the weaker places of the body, including the many
"pressure points" of the body, are, allowing them to cause massive amounts of
damage with a single touch.  Use of these pressure points can often lead to a
monk stunning an attacker in a single move or even on rare occassions lead to
an enemy's death.
&C(Use of 'anatomy knowledge' is automatic once trained.)

0 'FLYING KICK'~
&Wsyntax:&w flying  &C(while in combat)

Highly trained in the martial arts, skilled monks often improve their kicking
abilities, using their incredible speed and agility to lauch themselves into

0 TRIP~
&Wsyntax:&w trip  &C(While in combat)
&wMaster thieves, pocessing a near perfect fluid grace to their movements, are
often fast enough to duck down low, using one leg to sweep an attacker's
legs out from under him, before their enemy is even aware of their
intenions.  This usually leaves the victim stunned on the ground as the
impact of the fall knocks the wind from him.
&C(Trip is similar to the warrior skill of 'stun' in it's effect.)

not always.

1 'GOLDEN AURA'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: cast 'golden aura' <target>
&w
Masters of self-defense and healing, clerics are able to errect an aura about
themselves reducing damage by 3/4's.  This spell may be used with sanctuary
for an accumulative effect and clerics are able to offer their holy
protection to others around them, but none save a cleric is able to control
the sheer power of this magic.  Mobs & Players affected by golden aura have a
line saying: "&Y<Target> body radiates a crisp golden aura.&w" when you type look
in the same room.
(&CGolden Aura can't be invoked by any, but those with the ability to cast it.&w)

1 'SHRIEK'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: shriek  &C(While in combat)
&w
Harnessing the pure destructive power of sound, bards are able to shatter
glass in a player's inventory or even in a protected container.  The only
glass generally found on players of any value is that used in the creation of
potions, vials & flasks.
(&CAside from causing a base damage amount with each shriek, every potion that
is shattered adds an extra 10 damage, with a maximum limit of 25 potions
destroyed per shriek.&w)

1 'SPIT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: spit  &C(While in combat)
&w
Using their own acidic saliva, lizardmen have become very adept at fighting
while spiting at their opponents.  The saliva causes a fair ammount of damage
and poisons the ennemy.  On occasion, they aim their spit at the facial part
of their ennemies, thus they can hit the eyes or mouth, rendering their
opponent either blind or unable to cast spells.
&z
*&WNOTE&z*&w Spit is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "lizardman" race or 
it will not work.

-1 'TRANSPORT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: transport <item> <player>
&w
Transport was created as a convience to players so they wouldn't have to use
the auction channel to pass items between themselves when they're far apart
throughout the mud.  There are a couple things to keep in mind here though:
&z
*&w This command is for your convience, do NOT abuse it in any way.  This means
  sending tons of items to a player that does not want them and loading up
  their eq for either annoyance or PK reasons.  I don't care the reasoning
  behind it, it's not here as a new PK strategy.
&z
*&w Please ASK a player before transporting them equipment to keep misunder-
  standings from occuring.
&W
Ok, now that that's out of the way, here's how it works:
&wYou type:&g  transport quill ashin
&wYou see:&g   You transport magical quill to Ashin.
&wSent back:&g Magical quill appears magically in your hands from Ashin.

-1 AFKMES 'AFKMESSAGE'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: afkmes <message>  &C(Your name is autoput before the message.)
&w
This is just a way of customizing the messages others receive when they try
to send you tells while you're AFK (Away From the Keyboard).
&c_____________________________________________________________________________
&cYou are a &YDwarf&c and have chosen the vocation of a &YMage&c.
&RAfk Message: &rAshin &W.  &W<---- &wFound in the 'score' list.
&cYou have &Y126/20&c hit, &C140/100&c mana, &G100/100&c movement, 21 practices.
etc...
&c_____________________________________________________________________________
&wLet's keep these clean though, ok?
&BExample&w:
&WYou type&w: afkmes is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.
&cSomeone tries to tell you something...
&cSomeone sees:&Y Ashin is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.

1 'FORGE COSTS'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wWhile much of the work in a dwarf's forging is magic coming from the forger,
a good deal of supplies are needed for creation of equipment.  Here's a list
of what forging will cost you:
&WBase Cost&w: level * 10000 &Y<GOLD>  &C(level 30 = 30000, level 105 = 1050000)
&w
Due to the differences in supplies necessary for the varying magical affects
there lies extra costs within the actual making of the equipment:
&W
&B             Damroll      &W=&w 10k      &B Hitroll       &W=&w 10k
&B             Stat Raises  &W=&w 5k       &B Hp\mana\AC    &W=&w 1k

&B             Saving-spell &W=&w 10k      &B Saving-breath &W=&w 10k

&z*&WNOTE&z*&w "Stat Raises" are referring to str, int, wis, dex & con

On the 1 shield only levels, ONLY SANCTUARY may be used.
When using shields on mobs, the HP of the mob must be reduced to take into
account for the shield bonuses. According to how many shields the mob has,
reduce the HP by using the following percentages to multiply the base hp by.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shields:  One        Two        Three        Four        Five        Six     
============================================================================
Percent:  80%        65%          50%         45%         35%        30%     
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So a level 99 mob with 6 shields would have (31000 * 30% = ) 6300 Hps.

110 DEATH2~
When you die, a corpse is made. If you are AT or UNDER LEVEL 20 it is sent
to the Morgue where you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. Then you have to
choose between the Bethaven Portal and the Ravenwood Portal. To choose, type 
ENTER BETHAVEN or ENTER RAVENWOOD.
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 when you die, a corpse is made at that very spot
where death hit you. You are sent to the morgue, and from there you have to
seek out and find your corpse once again to get your equipment back.
 
All affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.
Followers and group members are not affected by your death.
Followers will stop following you upon your death (or theirs, hehe)
 
&R**&W Corpses decay over time, and so do the object IN the corpses. You have
30 MUD HOURS (15 real minutes) to seek and collect all your corpse items.
Only you or members of your group may collect things FROM your corpse.&R**
 
REIMBURSEMENTS will NOT be done under normal circumstances.

Longsword       80%     100%      slash, slice
Greatsword      85%     100%      slash, chop
Axe             80%      90%      chop
Blunt           70%      90%      hit, pound, crush

Exotic         var%     var%      suction, blast 
-------------------------------------------------------
 
So a level 60 dagger could have (60 x 2 x 75% = ) 80 points for hitroll and
(60 x 2 x 50% = ) 60 points for damroll. Similarly, a level 20 mace could have
(20 x 2 x 70% = ) 28 points for hitroll and (20 x 2 x 90% = ) 36 points for
damroll.
Exotic weapons use a varying percent based on the kind of magical weapon it
is. In order to keep them in line, the variable percent has 150 points which
can be split into the two percentages, no more than 100% on one.
Remember: ONLY WEAPONS get a hitroll and damroll bonus added to them. And
only weapons and items worn on hands are allowed to have an anti-disarm
bonus to them.

This spell is a more powerfull form of BLESS.
~
0 BLUR~
Syntax: cast blur

~
0 FLURY~

~
0 ALIGNMENT ALIGN~
ALIGNMENT is that state in which your character is GOOD, NEUTRAL, or EVIL in
behavior and beliefs.
 
There are many "spectrums" of Alignment, but the above three are the main
states.
 
Alignment is mostly there for roleplaying purposes, in that you act out your
Alignment. Some mobs react differently to certain Alignments, and some
equipment may or may not be usable by certain alignments.
 
Roleplaying is certainly encouraged here at EYE OF THE STORM II, but is not
mandatory and the guideline of RESPECT and CONSIDERATION should also be 
a big thought when Roleplaying.
~
0 FIREBALL~
&BSyntax: &Wcast 'fireball' <victim>
 
Fireball is another distinctive spell, that is almost always
associated with mages.  This spell is a favourite among most
mages, because of it's large offensive &Ppower&W.  Truly, it is much
more fun to turn your enemies into a pile of &Pcharred steak&W, then
to do some minor damage on them.
~
0 'ACID BLAST'~
&BSyntax:&W cast 'acid blast' <victim>
 
Acid Blast is another &Pnasty&W mage spell.  When a mage is in combat, sometimes
they use this spell to severely hurt their enemy.  When casted, streaks of very 
potent acid come shooting out of the casters fingers.  If this acid hits the 
skin, it will eat away at it, and leave some very large and &Punpleasant gaping 
wounds&W.

&BSyntax: &Weat   <object>

&BSyntax: &Wrescue <character>
 
Rescue is the exact opposite of flee.  With flee you are showing such
cowardice by running away.  But if you notice someone who is in trouble,
you can &Ptry &Wto rescue them.  This means that you will take the monsters
attention away from the person who is in &Ptrouble&W.  The monster will then
try and beat on you.
 
&RNote:&W In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

1 EQ_RESTRICTIONS~
&z____________________________________________________________________________
&wThere are factors that prevent certain races and/or classes from using a
particular piece of equipment. These factors are as follows;
 
&WRACE&w: The race of your character may affect what he or she can or
      cannot use.
For Example: A minotaur will not be able to wear most helmets due to its
             great head-size and horns.

&WSIZE&w: The size or race of your character depends greatly on which
      equipment you can or cannot use.
For Example: A pixie will not be able to wear the same breastplate that
             a minotaur can and vice-versa.
 
&WCLASS&w: Your class(es) may affect what equipment you can or cannot use.
       Multi-classed characters may have a difficult time finding equipment.
For Example: Certain beliefs may not allow that class to use a particular
             type of weapon or armor. Vampires can use only cutting weapons,
             as their goal is to draw blood.
 
&RNote&w: Materials of equipment also affects some classes. Currently, the
      Werewolf is prevented from using anything made of silver.

1 MAGE_RESTRICTIONS MAG_RESTRICTIONS~
&z____________________________________________________________________________
&wDue to the overwhelming amount of time it takes for mages to study in
preparation for their spellcasting stage, they do not have the time to
practice with hand-to-hand combat. Even those classes with mage as their
second must devote much time and concentration on the language of magic.
This explains why the mage class(es) do not have time to learn how to use
heavier and more complicated means of weaponry.
&WThe mage class is restricted to using small cutting weapons, daggers,
knives and blunt weaponry. Almost any staff or wand can be used by a mage.
&wArmor worn by the mage is greatly considered when spellcasting. Wearing
a suit of platemail and casting a lightning bolt spell is not an intelligent
thing to do. For this reason, mages have armor restrictions due to spellcasting.
&WA mage cannot wear any heavy metallic armor, such as platemail, chainmail,
and studded leathers and other heavily metallic accessories. He/she is
restricted to leather armor or worse (unless magically enchanted for that
class).
&z______________________________________________________________________

&RNote&w: Some exceptions are made, and this is strictly by the builders own
      reasoning and by the acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 CLERIC_RESTRICTIONS CLE_RESTRICTIONS~
&z____________________________________________________________________________
&wA cleric (whether good or evil) goes by his or her beliefs before any
other factor in life. It is up to you, as the player behind your character
to decide and follow what those beliefs will be. As a general rule, clerics
use only the weapons allowed by their Deity. In most common cases, this
involves using a blunt weapon.
&WClerics are restricted to using blunt weapons only except where their
Deity permits otherwise. Roleplaying a good aligned cleric will find you
in sticky spots for finding weaponry, as there are not many slashing weapons
available for those that are good at heart. Most every cleric is fluent with
staves and most wands (except for those which are magically enchanted against
him/her).
&wArmor by most clerics is what their Deity provides for them... a good prayer
and a strong will. The motto "take only what you need" is popular with most
clergy and is usually lived up to. This again, depends on the clerics Deity
and what is permitted.
&WClerics are restricted to using only chainmail or worse armor (unless a
specific armor is magically enchanted for their usage).
&z____________________________________________________________________________
 
&RNote&w: Most clerical weapons will be alignment-dependant, although some
      exceptions are made at the builders discretion and by the
      acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 THIEF_RESTRICTIONS THI_RESTRICTIONS~
&z______________________________________________________________________________
&wThieves are skilled in balance and dexterity, however using a two-handed sword
to maneuver into backstab position is quite impossible even for the best in
that field. Big and flashy weapons also get in the way when hiding in shadows
is necessary. A club or staff is difficult to conceal within the folds of
your armor and clothing!
&WThieves are restricted to using small weapons that are easily hidden away
from wandering eyes. Some thieves, however are better at concealing larger
weaponry, so a thief may use any type of piercing weapon. Wands and staves
are not usable by thieves.
&wBulky clothing is a no-no for thieves, unless it is made of a very flexible
material. Flexibility is a must for agility and therefore a suit of platemail
armor would not assist you in moving silently. Hiding in the shadows is also
necessary for most thieves and a flashy suit of metal will most likely catch
any glimpse of light and create a reflection which will then give away your
position.
&WChainmail or worse is a thieves common armoury, protecting him from that shot
or swing that manages to hit home. Quick movements and dodging are not easy
when you are armoured to the hilt. Bright and flashy equipment is also not
favoured by thieves as it is likely to make them stand out, contrary to their
goal.
&z_______________________________________________________________________________
 
&RNote&w: Some exceptions are made because of magically enchanted weapons and
      armor, but this is at the builders discretion and by the acceptance
      of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 WARRIOR_RESTRICTIONS WAR_RESTRICTIONS~
&z_______________________________________________________________________________
Because of their heavy training and knowledge about each specific type of
weapon and its usage, warriors are able to use most all types of battlements
proficiently. Though many warriors may learn the theory behind their fighting
tactics, they prefer to learn from the practical side.
&WWarriors may use any type of weapon, large or small. They are restricted from
using any type of magical wand or staff, however.
&wIn training, a warrior is taught how to use almost anything as armoury. This
in turn gives them no armor restrictions of any types.
&WWarriors are permitted to use any type of armor (unless magically enchanted
specifically against his/her class).
&z_______________________________________________________________________________
 
&RNote&w: Some exceptions may apply at the discretion of the builder and by
      the acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.
