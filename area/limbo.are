The Mighty Darkside~
Here floats a god so evil, you cannot bear to look at it.
~
It has a large central eye that projects an anti-magic ray and ten
eyestalks atop the round body which can do anything from charm you
to disintegrate you.  Beholders are not known for their personality.

Limbo~
You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

Frag's Hovel~
You are in a small, miserable, dwelling (for those of you nincompoops who
don't know what a HOVEL is).  It's dark, dank, and cold.  At one end of the
room, you see a sorry excuse of a rusty, squeaky bunkbed.  Obviously, neither
of the beds are made.  A dirty, ragtorn teddy bear sleeps heavily on the
lower bunk.  You see, to your dismay, TWO clock radios, both of which are
ringing, which shows that this room was made for TWO people to sleep in,
although it's barely 10 X 12 feet.  Papers, books, and laundry are thrown
everywhere, with two computers astrally linked to the world of Envy.
