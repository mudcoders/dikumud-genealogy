In the shaft~
The breeze in the shaft starts to flush the smell of rot and death out of 
your nose.  You dread the thought of having to go back down to leave this
place and pray that the breeze means and exit ahead.

the mossy tunnel~
This mossy tunnel has the huge tracks in it heading both ways, there are
also a few deer and rabbit bones strewn about, but generally it is a 
pleasant sight from what you saw below.  You hope never to have to go
down to face that mess again.

mossy tunnel mouth~
You are at the end of a tunnel looking to the south.  You are standing on a
12 foot drop off that leads into a deep thick green forest.  You do not see
an easy way down except for the southern drop.
