Name        The horrid interchange~
Descr
You are at an intersection and no way seems safe.  This dirty passage is as
easily rank as the rest of it.  You hear snuffling and shuffling coming from
everywhere around you.  The walls here echo every sound making it impossible
to tell where the noise is coming from.  Of course, the walls also seem to
intensify the smell.

Name        The trolls den~
Descr
The filth and the smell has gotten real bad in this area.  All the worst 
things you can believe in have been tied up and spread out over this room.
Such filth makes is impossible and unsafe to search.  You have never been 
in such a filthy place in your life.  Bones, guts, smashed bits of armor.
It is amazing that the paladins never found this place in their time at
Naytil.

Name        Hallway of mushrooms~
Descr
This hallway is full of various fungi.  Unfortunatly none of it is good to
eat. The poison of all these mushrooms is so potent that you can smell it
in the air.  The stench of the rot of the fungi and the animals that have
fallen for it makes this room as unbearable as the rest of the joint.

Name        In the shaft~
Descr
The breeze in the shaft starts to flush the smell of rot and death out of 
your nose.  You dread the thought of having to go back down to leave this
place and pray that the breeze means and exit ahead.

Name        the mossy tunnel~
Descr
This mossy tunnel has the huge tracks in it heading both ways, there are
also a few deer and rabbit bones strewn about, but generally it is a 
pleasant sight from what you saw below.  You hope never to have to go
down to face that mess again.

Name        mossy tunnel mouth~
Descr
You are at the end of a tunnel looking to the south.  You are standing on a
12 foot drop off that leads into a deep thick green forest.  You do not see
an easy way down except for the southern drop.
