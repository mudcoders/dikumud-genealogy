All true adventurers must take risks each day they wake up.  But why risk
your life when you can risk your gold?  Several GAMES are available for
the diversion of adventurers (and of their wealth).

PLAY or GAMBLE (they are synonymous) without an argument will tell you which
games you can play at your present location.  Including a game name will,
if possible, include you in that game.  If you also include the name of a
croupier, you can specify whose game you will join.

To talk with the other players in your game, you can use GTALK or '-'.  You
can see various statistics and current information with the SHOW command.

Most games have a limit to the amount of gold you are allowed to win over
your lifetime.  If you reach this limit but still wish to play the game, 
you may DEDUCT a certain amount from your winnings, so that you may play
again.  You may also RESET the statistics if you'd like to do so.

In order to stop playing a game, type QUIT or END.  You will also be forced
to quit the game if you attack someone or are attacked by someone, suffer
damage due to poison or other injuries, or leave the game location for most
games.

The current games available on EnvyMud are:

0 BLACKJACK TWENTY-ONE~
BLACKJACK, or TWENTY-ONE as it is often called, is a card game played by
two to ten players, one of whom is the DEALER.  Each player is asked to
place a BET, then is dealt two cards from a DECK face up, except for the
dealer, whose first card (the 'hole' card) is dealt face down.  The object
of the game is to make your hand total more than the dealer's hand, but no
more than 21.  If both you and the dealer end up with the same total, it is
called a PUSH, and your money is returned to you.

If your hand totals 21 with your first two cards (an ace with either a
ten or a face card), you have 'blackjack' (or a 'natural') and automatically
win back 1-1/2 times your original bet.  If you do not have blackjack,  you
can HIT to ask for another card, SPLIT identical cards to play two hands,
DOUBLE your bet and receive just one card, or STAND on the hand you have.
Aces can count for either 1 or 11 points, depending on which will give you
the better score.

The dealer must follow strict guidelines:  hit on 16, stand on 17.  If
the dealer's up card (the one not facing down) is an ace, you may take 
out an INSURANCE bet against blackjack.

If you keep hitting without going over 21 (which is called a BUST), you can
earn special bonuses.  If you stand with 5 cards in your hand, you
automatically win back double your bet.  If you stand with 6 cards, you 
win triple your bet.  And if you manage to get 7 cards in your hand without
busting, you automatically win 4 times your bet.  But as the payoffs imply,
these hands are hard to come by.
~

-1 UPPER-LOWER-TRIPLE 'UPPER LOWER TRIPLE' UPPER LOWER TRIPLE~
UPPER-LOWER-TRIPLE is a simple dice game.  You place a BET with a choice 
of upper, lower, or triple.  The dealer then rolls three dice, and their
values are added up.  If the result is 11 or greater, it is an "Upper",
and if the resut is 10 or less, it is a "Lower".  If, however, all three
dice show the same numbers, it is a "Triple" and those who bet on it win
back 36 times their wager!  Unfortunately, all other bets are off if a 
Triple is rolled.
~

-1 DEALER CROUPIER~

Each gambling game must have someone in charge, and this person is 
traditionally known as a CROUPIER.  For card games, the term DEALER is
more common.  The CROUPIER is in total control of the game, and can
turn away unwelcome customers.  Keep your eyes out, though...some of 
the croupiers have been known to take advantage of unwary players.
~

-1 DECK~

The standard deck of cards has four suits (spades, hearts, clubs, and
diamonds), with thirteen cards in each suit: A (or ace), 2 (or deuce),
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (or jack), Q (or queen), and K (or king).
In games where the values of the cards are added (such as BLACKJACK),
the 'face cards' (J, Q, K) are worth ten points, and the other cards are
worth 'face value'.  The value of the ace is usually 1, though in 
BLACKJACK it can also count as 11.  See the helps for a particular game
for additional information about any cards it may use.
~

0 ANTE~
Syntax: ante

In order to begin some games (most notably POKER), you must put in an
ANTE.  The amount is set by the croupier.
~

0 BET WAGER~
Syntax: bet   <amount>
Syntax: bet   <amount> <choice>
Syntax: bet    limit
Syntax: wager <amount>
Syntax: wager <amount> <choice>
Syntax: wager  limit

During a gambling game, you will occasionally need to place a BET.  The
syntax of the wager will depend on the particular game in which you are
participating.  Wagering the 'limit' will automatically place the maximum
bet, if you have enough gold.
~

0 CARDS~
Syntax: cards
Syntax: cards all
Syntax: show cards
Syntax: show all

The CARDS command shows you the cards you are currently holding, if any.
If appropriate, it will also give you the score of your current hand(s).
Adding "all" will show you the cards that all players are holding.
~

0 CALL SEE~
Syntax: call
Syntax: see

If you want to stay in a hand when you owe money, you may CALL or SEE the
bets placed by other gamblers.

See also: CHECK, FOLD, and RAISE
~

0 CHECK~
Syntax: check

In rounds of POKER where you do not wish to (or cannot) RAISE, you may 
CHECK to stay in the hand.  Once someone has raised after the current
deal, however, you will have to CALL, RAISE, or FOLD.

See also: CALL, FOLD, and RAISE
~

0 DEDUCT~
Syntax: deduct <amount> <game>

Sometimes players win so much money at a particular game that the
CROUPIERS refuse to let them gamble.  If you would like to play the game
again, you may DEDUCT some money from your winnings and give it to "the
house".  If you deduct enough, you will be allowed to join in once again.
~

0 FOLD~
Syntax: fold

If you think that you do not have a chance to win the current game,
you may FOLD and cut your losses.  Don't FOLD if no one has made a 
bet yet, though; simply CHECK and wait to see if you are forced to
put in more money.

See also: CALL, CHECK, and RAISE
~

0 RAISE +~
Syntax: raise <amount>
Syntax: +     <amount>

If you feel that your hand warrants putting more money into the pot,
you may RAISE the stakes.  Heck, your hand doesn't even have to warrant
it.  That's what bluffing is all about!  '+' is a synonym for RAISE.

See also: CALL, CHECK, and FOLD
~

0 DOUBLE 'DOUBLE DOWN'~
Syntax: double

In BLACKJACK, if you feel confident that one more card will give you
an unbeatable total, you may DOUBLE your bets.  This card will be the 
only one you receive, and you may only do this as the first hit.
~

0 END~
Syntax: end
Syntax: quit

In order to stop playing a gambling game, simply type END or QUIT. 
Because of the syntax, you will be unable to leave EnvyMud until you
stop gambling.

is shared only with the other players currently playing a gambling game
with you.  '-' is a synonym for GTALK.
~

0 HANDS~
Syntax: hands
Syntax: show hands

If you are trying to decide how good your current poker hand is, you may
type HANDS to see the ranking of all poker hands.
~

0 HIT~
Syntax: hit

If you want another card dealt to you while playing BLACKJACK, you can 
ask for a HIT.  If it is your first chance for a hit, and you think that
the next card is all you will want, you may DOUBLE your bet and automatically
STAND on the result.

See also: DOUBLE, SPLIT, and STAND
~

0 INSURANCE~

While playing BLACKJACK, occasionally the DEALER'S up card will be an
ace.  Since there is a significant chance that the dealer has blackjack,
you are offered the chance to take out an 'insurance' bet against this
occurring.  If you decide to INSURE, you automatically wager 1/4 of your
original bet, saying that you think the dealer has a natural.  If you
are correct, you win your insurance bet (but lose your original bet).
Otherwise, you lose your insurance bet.
~

0 INSURE YES NO~
Syntax: insure yes
Syntax: insure no

~

0 RESET~
Syntax: reset <game>

~

0 SPLIT~
