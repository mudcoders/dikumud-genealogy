that actually seems cozy with a small fire
in the middle keeping the place warm.  The walls while 
undecorated are clean and well-kempt, though you think

Before you is the gnome city called Little Haven.
It's bustling, with cheery little folk who seem
dwarven in ancestry and yet look upon you with
a little suspicion.  The tunnels are vast, and from this
vantage point you can see the huge fortress way
in the distance.  You have a long way to go.
