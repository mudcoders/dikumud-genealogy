=== How to Install

First, group with your highest level Unix guru, and have him or her tank.
Mythran is easy to install than some muds, but every site is different.

(1) Get the release Mythran-1.0.tar.gz from a web-site, and place it
    in a directory where you want it to go (ex. /home/mythran on linux)

(2) Unpack the release.

	gunzip -c Mythran-1.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

(3) Go into the 'src' directory.  Choose the Makefile for your operating
    system and copy it into 'Makefile':

	Makefile		Most machines with 'gcc'
	Makefile.aix		AIX
	Makefile.hp		Hp/UX
	Makefile.irx		Most machines running IRIX
	Makefile.mip		Mips Risc/OS
	Makefile.nex		NeXT
	Makefile.solaris	SunSoft Solaris 2.1
	Makefile.sys		Sequent SysV
	Makefile.tek		Tektronix xd88s
	Makefile.linux		Linux (worked on 1.2.1 and 1.2.13)
	Makefile.sunos4		SunOS
	Makefile.dos		MS-Dos running DJGPP by DJ-Delorie

    See 'port.txt' for more information on porting, including the
    single-user MsDos and Macintosh versions.

(4) Run 'make' with the following options:

	make -k >&! make.out

    This will take 10 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on the speed of your
    computer.

    If you encounter errors with 'make', send us your 'make.out' file:

	mail -s make.out v942346@hhs.nl < make.out

    Also we'll need to know what kind of hardware, operating system,
    and C compiler you have.

    We will help you get Mythran running, but obviously we can't guarantee
    Mythran will run on any particular machine.

(5) Start the game:

	startup &
	telnet localhost 1234
	
(6) To make your first immortal character, just start as a mortal
    character, play at least as far as level 2, and then edit the
    player file and change your level.  (After the first immortal,
    you can advance the rest).

(7) If you haven't already done so, read 'license.doc', 'license.txt',
    'license.nvy' and 'license.myt'.  Because Mythran is a derivative
    work of Diku Mud, you must register your mud with the original Diku
    implementors.
  
(8) Of course you're going to change the title screen, help files, and so on.
    Don't just globally erase the 'Merc' references, ok?  You wouldn't
    like it if we did that to your work, so don't do it to ours.


=== Support

First, read the documentation in the 'doc' directory. The files are not as
up to date as they should be but they contain most important information.

Also check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the
individual immortal commands.

(Immortal commands are considered Skills now and must be edited into
 playerfiles manually.  See 'pfile.txt' for more details)

We have a mailing list, at 'merc-l@webnexus.com'.  Send mail to
'merc-l-request@webnexus.com' to join the list.

You can write to us directly at the e-mail addresses at the top of this
document.

When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If
you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.

Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a
crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are
ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.

If your e-mail is too vague, we're likely to bounce it back.  There are two
of us and hundreds of you -- we simply can't engage in long-distance debugging,
on unknown platforms, with the added factor of more code that you've dropped in
since the release.



=== Future Plans

Mythran Mud contains many structure improvements over Envy. Some
ideas which have been incorporated were suggested by our many players.
A few of these ideas have been created using the 'Reverse Engineering'
method.

Enjoy.
