************************************************
Alright.. that's all I have so far for the magic user spells. I've taken 
some out from the spell list I sent you and I've add some in as well.. 
The following are some ideas for Immortal skill!!
************************************************

Name: 	Permanency
Effect:		This skill will save the player with all his/her spells 
intact.  So whatever spells was casted on the player will become a 
permanent skill the player can possess..

Think that's all for now..
