  You don't think that you are not floating in nothing.
It is very Void-like ;)

Limbo~
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

Swiftest's Fabulous Palace~
You stand in awe before the great palace of the great, great, great god,
Swiftest. Your breath is taken away by the sheer grandeur, the astounding
elegance embodied in such a fine semblence of Heaven.

Swiftest's Private Chambers~
From here, the sounds of the outside world die down to a murmur. You
feel at peace in this room. The furniture can only be described as
dreamy, as you see a white cloud--shaped like a very comfy sofa--float
lazily by. The soft light streams from above from a singular point and
spreads smoothly in distinct colorful rays dancing and mixing together.

of Cristis the Kind...a ruler of the outlying regions around Midgaard many
years ago...
  The door to the north has been permanently jammed; the southern door seems to
have been ripped out of its hinges so there is nothing but an opening to the
south. The room slopes downward towards the north to a stone door.

  This king must have been well loved. Great care was taken into the creation
of this altar. It stands only about 2 feet high with the remnants of candle-
wax on its top surface. It says in ancient tongue on its dusty top:
              "Praise the almighty Cristis the bringer of
                 good and justice to the world. He who 
                fought the evilest finally is at peace
               may the Gods remember him forever..."

the evil creatures that have invaded his domain and grave...He stands here
shimmeringly desolid and quite unable to effect the outside world or be
effect by the outside world...he is quite old, but very kind looking...
He holds up a tiny piece of parchment for all to read and look at with a
glimmer of tears in his eyes...
~
E
parchment~
  It says an aweful lot for its apperent size:
     "Hello stranger and last hope for Midgaard and this tomb!
   or just anyone who passes through my tomb.  This is a last plea
   for aid by a man long since dead from this Earth.  I have served
   all my life for the cause of good and hope for your help now 
   that my time has passed.  
     The forces of evil have taken control of this tomb and the great
   Kings of old need your aid to free us and deliver us to peace 
   once again. I think that I alone have been able to make myself
   appear and manage to have the last acolyte here write this note,
   for I am unable to speak, or affect this dying world.
     These forces of evil plan to eventually take over Midgaard
   and the outlying reaches for their own! They MUST be stopped. No one
   knows how long this will take it could be days it could be months!
     Their leader goes by the name of Roch'tar, the reincarnated Vampire
   of a time somewhere after my death.  He is yet not able to enter
   this world presently but is somewhere still trapped here in these
   tombs.  You MUST stop him by sytematically destroying his minions
   and followers who he has created from the dead and called from the 
   bowels of the earth!!!
     Thank you all who may endeaver to succeed and and may the Gods
   bless you on your Quest!"

 Two hints: in order to leave this place you must get the special 
    rod from a hidden vault in a room down and to the east somewhere...
    this room will be a painted room as well...look vault and it will
    tell you what to do...the second hint is that I may appear elsewhere
    in the lower sections of the tombs for more help!

to hold a several score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven

tell that these things must have been worth much but they have not lasted
well throughtout the ages. Massive doors lead off to the south and a small

tapesties~
  The tapesties were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of battles
long ago. One on the left your shows the historic battle between Jubal the
Benevolent and Hroth Kragen's forces that eventually Jubal's army won (of
course) and was responsible for the forming the city within which you now
reside.  Here was the most inportant stategic point in Jubal's supply-line
due to the how remote it is and of course it was (at that time) the last
major population and mercanile district before the sea...where of course
Hroth's forces were eventually driven and demolished.

squashed by these monsters as well...luckily this was not the case. Tho it
is now appearent that a new threat has appeared to the city and this region.
Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he turned to the dark ways
in his dying years...supposed he died an evil man...

The shrine of Mitnar the Conquerer~
  Noone ever really understood why he was laid to rest and honored here...
according to the writing on the wall Mitnar was quite a gruesome beast of
a man...he loved battle...and nothing else.  But many warrior has passed
thru Midgaard over the years and warriors did love Mitnar he was the 
perfect warrior and all fighting men looked up to this man...
  On the wall is depicted battle after battle after battle. Not much 
was really accomplished by this man that you can tell...
  A small opening has been shaped carefully to the east.

The tomb of Mitnar the Conquerer~
  Hmm...neat place. you can tell that it once held quite an inventory of
Gold, treasure and weapons because the wall paintings show dramatic scenes
of men and women warriors alike bowing down to their dead God-figure,
Mitnar. Scenes show get heaps of treasure and weapons sacrificed to the 
Great Mitnar. Even today there exist cult worshipers of this long dead
great warrior and king. Where his coffin was...there is now only a 
rectangular blemish on the floor of the dusty room...hmm...there is something
odd about the floor tho...the western wall has a hole punched through it as
well.

  More blood and gore are settled into this room...the stench is unbearable.
The walls are almost covered in blood and little chunks of dried meat. Almost
as if it were painted on...ICK! in fact there is a purposeful look to it.
  The original paintings on the wall still are visible...but you still have
an urge to vomit!
  A distant moan is heard...tho you cant really place it.
  The normal exit to the south has been totally blocks by rubble systematically
piled there, and the door to the north is barred shut...thus the only way
to go is either east or west.

  Interesting...judging from the artwork Frath the Penniless was a very
generous ruler in his time...an excellent economist it seems...the joke at 
the time was that he gave out so much money that he was penniless himself!
He thus recieved that title by default.

body lies out in the open but ripped to pieces and partially gnawed pieces

raised somehow because the only exit is downward from where you came...

  The stench of death is heavy in here...you think you may get easily lost

  The room has been totally hollowed out and smoothed...and a pit has
been drilled in the center of the floor (though nothing is in it).
  Also extensive gruesome paintings of beasts and monsters terrorizing the
country side; vampires sucking the blood of beasts and humans alike...
the scenes are horribly graphic.
The Ghost of Cristis is floating here...

  Written on it he says :
      "Congratuations adventurer you made it this far! Now, in order
    to get out of here look at the vault hidden in the painting and
    get the key pry rod that will take you out...if you have passed
    through all of these monsters and abonimations with ease you are
    ready to continue. But if not the rod will help you get out.The
    Vault will clue you on what to open.
      There exists nearby a horrid beast called Snapper Joe...he is
    a reincarnated fiend called up directly from hell...he is tough
    but if you manage to kill him he has a key to the lower depths 
    of these horrid tombs and catacombs. I cant promise you what lies
    ahead but it will promise to be challenging and hopefully will
    prove that we are nearing the end of the reign of the Horrid
    Roch'tar.
      If you need to rest and come back, take the rod. But remember to 
    dump it so that others will have a chance at continuing here also.
      Thank you again brave fellows!"

serenity. You can follow the road north or south.

The Turning Point~
  The trees stand close here, and the tall, bushy undergrowth prevents you
from seeing far in any direction save north, where a broad lane leads off into
the distance; and west, where the same lane continues towards what looks like
a fairly large city. The muted sounds of city commotion reach your ears from a
distance; stray dogs barking, children crying, and street salesmen shouting.
  Down the hill, you notice a trail leading to a dwarven village...

forest; and to the west it becomes the main street of the town; surrounded by
a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.

shell, this small shack still stands guarding the entrance both to the
city and to the city hall.

a mess. The back wall as been completely knocked down revealing an 
entrance into another building through yet another collapsed wall.

find broken shelves and workbenches with various vials and pouches spilling
contents all across the floor. This was possibly the magic shop of the
city. The doorway to the east is blocked, making the only exit back west.

have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on

the state the walls are in, this could very well be a large AGGRESSIVE animal. 
This makes you pretty insecure, this stating your feeling about the place, 
quite mildly.

This place has quite a good view over Midgaard. Your possibilities of movement
seems to extend only to up and down. Unless you want to let go of the secure

The Chain where it's too windy~
Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way of leaving down 
from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a
totally impossible task. The ascend is the only way ahead for you.
Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT
DESCEND NOW OR YOU'LL SURELY DIE!!!!

On the Great Chain of Naris~
You are approximately on the middle of the treacherous Chain. One false step
and death will come and collect you quickly. The chain leads upwards and down.
No way are you going to descend now... You've only just begun your climb.
Besides it could cost you your life. Look down and you'll see why.~

The Chain~
As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

rumpled bed and a table piled high with yestercycle's dirty dishes.
