Fully automated auction channel
-------------------------------

Last update: Dec 15, 1995

Should work on : MERC2.2

Fixed since last update:
 Added the db.c allocation/initialization
 Reference to update_handler() was omitted.

Know bugs and limitations yet to be fixed:

- Shutdown/reboot will cause loss of item

=========

Withing this letter you will find my version of an automatic auction, as seen
on MUDs like Mystic Adventure (miniac.etu.gel.ulaval.ca 4000 :). I must
admit that it IS greatly inspired by exactly that great MUD :)

bet.h: contains advatoi, which converts an 'advanced' number contained within
 a string to a number. An advanced number can have the k and m letters to 
 signify 1000s and 1000000s. E.g.: 14k4 will translate to 14400, 200k to
 200 000 etc.
 also contains parsebet, which takes an existing number and an argument -
 this argument is parsed like an advanced number, but you can also pass it
 'x?' to multiply the existing number by ?, and +? which will add ? percent.

 I realize that those could be written better and more efficiently :)

/*
  This function allows the following kinds of bets to be made:

  Absolute bet
  ============

  bet 14k, bet 50m66, bet 100k

  Relative bet
  ============

  These bets are calculated relative to the current bet. The '+' symbol adds
  a certain number of percent to the current bet. The default is 25, so
  with a current bet of 1000, bet + gives 1250, bet +50 gives 1500 etc.
  Please note that the number must follow exactly after the +, without any
  spaces!

  The '*' or 'x' bet multiplies the current bet by the number specified,
  defaulting to 2. If the current bet is 1000, bet x  gives 2000, bet x10
  gives 10,000 etc.

*/

int advatoi (const char *s)
/*
  util function, converts an 'advanced' ASCII-number-string into a number.
  Used by parsebet() but could also be used by do_give or do_wimpy.

  Advanced strings can contain 'k' (or 'K') and 'm' ('M') in them, not just
  numbers. The letters multiply whatever is left of them by 1,000 and
  1,000,000 respectively. Example:

  14k = 14 * 1,000 = 14,000
  23m = 23 * 1,000,0000 = 23,000,000

  If any digits follow the 'k' or 'm', the are also added, but the number
  which they are multiplied is divided by ten, each time we get one left. This
  is best illustrated in an example :)

  14k42 = 14 * 1000 + 14 * 100 + 2 * 10 = 14420

  Of course, it only pays off to use that notation when you can skip many 0's.
  There is not much point in writing 66k666 instead of 66666, except maybe
  when you want to make sure that you get 66,666.

  More than 3 (in case of 'k') or 6 ('m') digits after 'k'/'m' are automatically
  disregarded. Example:

  14k1234 = 14,123

  If the number contains any other characters than digits, 'k' or 'm', the
  function returns 0. It also returns 0 if 'k' or 'm' appear more than
  once.
