/*  
    This code was written by Maniac to support the #GAMES section in the
    Envy2.0 area format... it was discribed in the area.txt but the code
    was not implemented... so i wrote my own... -- Maniac --

    This stuff is (C) 1996 The Maniac from Mythran Mud

    snippets can be found at my snippets page:
    	http://www.hhs.nl/~v942346/snippets/snippets.html

    Well... so much for the legal bullshit... now the code...

    Games: Version 2.0, now has support for cheating and bankrolls
	Written by The Maniac from Mythran Mud

    Radically changed game data structures in memory, OLC code and
    introduced several other enhancements including new style
    bankrolls. Older bankrolls used croupier->gold, and that wasn't
    Thelonius's idea from what i can see. Basically, 95% or so of
    dice game code is finished now, except multiplayer games. I don't
    want to waste time on that now since the interface needs to work
    for all games, including card games, etc. And these are yet to
    be done. -- Zen --
