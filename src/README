Mythran Mud release 3.1.11
Wed Mar 19, 1997


=== The src directory

This file gives a brief description of the files in the src directory.

	Makefiles
	source files
	startup scripts
	executable file
	What is new, what is old in the source



=== The Makefiles

Makefile	- Is the generic Makefile for machines with gcc
Makefile.aix	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for AIX Machines
Makefile.hp	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for HPUX Machines
Makefile.irx	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for IRIX Machines
Makefile.mip	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for MIPS Machines
Makefile.nex	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for the NeXT
Makefile.osf	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for the DEC OSF Alpha
Makefile.sol	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for Solaris 2.4
Makefile.std	- Is the generic Makefile for machines with gcc
Makefile.sys	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for the Sequent SysV
Makefile.tek	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for utek Machines

To compile the executable file 'mythran', you must first find the appropriate
Makefile for you.  Usually the Makefile provided is adequate.  But if you
match one of the other Makefiles, you would replace the current 'Makefile'
with the Makefile you choose to use.  For example, you are running a
machine running IRIX, so you choose the file 'Makefile.irx'.  You rename
'Makefile.irx' to 'Makefile' replacing it, then type 'make -k >&! a.out'

If you have problems with crypt, add to the NOCRYPT line in your Makefile
-DNOCRYPT.

We do not guarantee each Makefile will work for your system as each
system administrator will modify to his/her liking.  The Makefile are
only to be used as a close guideline for your system.

We extend a hearty thanks to all who have tested Envy source on these
ports.

=== The startup scripts

startup		- Is the startup script for mythran using CSH
Start		- Another very easy startup script


On most systems, 'startup &' is adequate for you.

If you wish a more indepth logging feature, 'Start' will give you that.

The startup script will create a number log file starting from 1000.log in
the log directory.  Should your game crash, and you have enabled core dumps
by setting your 'LIMIT coredumpsize unlimited' (see your system manual for
information on the command LIMIT), you will have a core file with a name
matching the appropriate log file in your src directory.

The startup script will run the executable named mythran.  This will
allow you to compile and test your code without worrying about
touching the running mud.  When you are done testing your testmud,
rename it as mythran.new in the src directory and reboot your "real" mud.
The startup script will automatically update your running executable
and backup your old one.

--- Debugging

Get to know the debugger setup in your computer system.  The most well known
are dbx, adb, and gdb.  My favorite is dbx.  All can be accessed by
issuing this command at your computer prompt, 'dbx mythran 1000.core'.  The
output is the line of code where the game has crashed.  To gain more
information, you must obtain a stack trace.  (See the system manual for
information on your resident debugger)



=== The executable file

The executable file is created after typing 'make'.  You must first choose
a Makefile best suited for your machine.  See 'port.txt' for more information.

After making, the executable file is named 'mythran' you may then boot the
game by executing the startup script 'startup' by typing 'startup &'.

To enter the game, type 'telnet localhost 1234' from your mud account.



=== What is new, what is old

This source is based on the Envy 2.0 release source code.  Some internal
workings have changed and some player visible improvements have been made.
We've been developing the code for the past 3 years with extensive playing.
Unfortunately, there might be bugs we have missed.  If you encounter errors
or bugs, first check your code additions then forward questions to the
Mythran Staff at mythran@envy.com.

All in all, Mythran will "feel" like any other envy mud out there.  Mythran is
designed to go beyond the envy releases and make into reality many
improvements that went undone in the envy releases.

Mythran does not support traditional C compilers.
