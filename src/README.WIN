# Instructions provided by Kenneth Dugas <dugas@porky.uchc.edu> for
# compilation of Envy 2.0 under Windows 95/NT using Visual C++ 2.0
#
# - Kahn

	Here are directions someone would need to compile the source
using Visual C++ 2.0.  There are a few other C compilers in common use
for NT/95, the directions would be somewhat different for them.

    1) Create a new project with project type = console application.

    2) Add all of the *.c files.  Do NOT add the *.h files.

    3) Ignore the 'cannot find whatever.h file' errors, it's not
    smart enough to ignore the files it will not need due to
    precompiler declarations.

    4) Select Project...Settings from the menu.

    5) Click on the LINK tab of the Project Settings dialog box.  Add
    wsock32.lib to the Object/Library Modules line. Click the OK button.

    6) Build the project.  It should compile without warnings.
