=== What's next?

I might finish and include these features in the next patch to EnvyMud.
These features are by NO MEANS guaranteed to be coded. You might notice most of
the ideas aren't highly original. You see, my mind is usually useless at having
ideas for what to do, if i don't have a goal :-)


		Now we have OLC the time is right to change the area format
		  while keeping compatibility with old areas (you will lose
		  some of the new format's features but that's life!).
		Add pose table to class files
                A new class different from the others (no Paladins please)!
		   ( ideas desperately needed, my mind is void... )
                Even more spells, even more skills.
                Traps (discussed in the Merc mailing list)
                Hunt & Track (SMAUG has this and there is a SillyMUD based
		  source somewhere) 
                Different damage types (FIRE, WATER, etc) like in ROM/SMAUG.
                  ( Should be VERY painful to add to Envy2.2 code :-( *sig* )
                Different "schools and spheres of knowledge" like in OBLIVION.
                  ( Not so painful to add but also very tiresome )
                Improved clans code ( The one now is very crap. I made it :) )
		Command History ( VERY nice )
		Alias allows things as: "alias vo cast 'vortex lift'"
		  and then "vo executioner" should expand to:
		  "cast 'vortex lift' executioner" but guess what? It doesn't!
		Add a couple more immskills ( never can have enough :-) )
		Bulletin Boards (like SMAUG's)
		Improved auction (like Erwin's idea)
		Online editing of classes & socials (save routine already made)
		Object affects, so you can make a 'One Ring' with invisibility,
		  true seeing for example (ROM already has this)
		RFC 1413 protocol use: well, SMAUG and Mordor feature this, so
		  it should be fairly simple to slam it in Envy2.2
		  Of course my knowledge of networking protocols is near zero
		  :-) But hey! The old art of cut & paste usually works... With
		  a few dozens of modifications...
