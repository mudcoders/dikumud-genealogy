UNNOFICIAL Zen's EnvyMud patch Release 0.85! (HomeCooked Envy2.2)
Monday, 14th July 1997

Zen             vasc@camoes.rnl.ist.utl.pt


=== Platforms

--- HomeCooked 0.85

These platforms have been directly tested:

	Generic PC	x86	Linux 2.+	-Use Makefile.lnx
	DEC		5900	Ultrix V4.3A	-Use Standard Makefile
	Sparc		10	Solaris 2.*	-Use Makefile.sol


If you have gcc on your system, it would be best to try the standard Makefile
first.  If you have cc on your system, it would be best to try the standard
Makefile with gcc replaced with cc.

The standard version of gcc as of this release is gcc 2.7.2.1

I am simply unable to test Envy on every platform. It should work on the same
platforms Envy2.2 does, since this code isn't very machine dependent (i think).


=== Requirements

The hardware requirements are essentially: two megabytes of memory; five
megabytes of disk space; any 32-bit processor; 50 kilobits per second network
bandwidth.  Processor speed is not important.

The software requirements are essentially: a C compiler; a Unix or
Unix-like operating system; BSD-compatible TCP/IP networking.

Envy uses 32-bit integers and is casual about the distinction between 'int' and
'long'.  (It is possible to clean up the code to run with 16-bit integers, but
the demand is nonexistent, and we don't have any 16-bit C compilers with which
to test.)  If you are running on a personal computer, make sure your C compiler
is giving you 32-bit integers and not running in 16-bit mode.

Area files, player files, the note file, class files, the socials file and the
bugs/ideas/typo files are all in ASCII format, so that they may be freely moved
from one machine type to another.



=== Performance

All this measured on a 16MB Pentium 100 MHz running Linux 2.0.27.

Boot time:    7 CPU seconds (Envy2.2: 5 CPU seconds on my system).
Memory:       5284 bytes SZ size.
CPU usage:    1.5 CPU minutes per hour + 1-2 CPU seconds per player.
Disk space:   6 megabytes plus 10K per player file.
IP packets:   about 10 per second with 20 people logged in. (?)
