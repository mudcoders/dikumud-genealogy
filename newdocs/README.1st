Zen             vasc@camoes.rnl.ist.utl.pt


=== INFO:

This code is now complete. I spell checked the new area and spells and 
corrected the spelling errors. The code is very stable and i think that a 
regular character can't crash the mud (unless there are some mean bugs in 
Envy2.2 code i don't know).
