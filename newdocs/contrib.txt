If your name isn't in here, and you think it should be; or if your name IS
in here and you prefer a different name or anonymity; then just e-mail me
and i'll fix it in the next release.



=== Information

Almost all of the features of HomeCooked were heavily based on work done by
someone else, so they deserve most of the credits not me. I mostly limited
myself to porting the code to the Envy2.2 code base, fixing bugs, and
occasionally rewriting some code. I wrote some details to the porting work
bellow so you can use them for your reference.

MOBProgs 2.1:	Written by J Murphy, N'Atas-Ha of ThePrincedom and
		  based on a concept created on Worlds of Carnage by

ROM 2.4:	ITEM_PORTAL, ITEM_WARP_STONE idea
		  (Made code from scratch for Envy2.2 - Zen)
		Spell "nexus", "portal" idea (Most of the code was rewritten)
		Most of the alias code itself except load/saving routines.
		ROM is a nice code base. It has some very nice features like:
		ITEM_FURNITURE, different damage types, wiznet (this is a must),
		affects like render a char invisible by just wearing an object,
		smarter mobs, etc.

		ROM consortium:
		  Russ Taylor (Alander), Gabrielle Taylor, and Brian Moore
		e-mail: Alander (rtaylor@pacinfo.com).


SMAUG team:	Social table structure in memory and social table hashing idea.
		A couple of functions were also taken from SMAUG code.
		Track/Hunting module.
		SMAUG is a great code base. I highly advise you to look at SMAUG
		unless you're totally addicted to a mud type, like i'm addicted
		to Envy :-) It has loads of features, spells/skills.

		SMAUG code team: Thoric, Altrag, Blodkai, Narn, Haus, Scryn,
		    Rennard, Swordbearer, Gorog, Grishnakh and Tricops
