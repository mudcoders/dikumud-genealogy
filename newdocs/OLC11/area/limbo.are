Add this object to limbo.are.  If vnum is taken already
then give it a new vnum and look in merc.h for DUMMY_OBJECT_VNUM
and change it to the vnum you assign this dummy object.
This object is used in OLC to ensure that a player will
boot if they get an item that has been created but not saved
and the game crashes before the object gets put into the database.
