=== What's new in this patch

Zen:		Converted skills from src/Contributions so they now work (easy)
		Ported ColoUr_V1.2 from Envy2.0 to Envy2.2 (easy)
		Scry spell for all caster classes
		Mass Vortex Lift spell for Clerics
		Vortex Lift spell for Mages and Psionicists
		Meteor Swarm (Drool Co design) spell for Mages
		Meditate skill for all caster classes
		Added Arena Code (suggested in sky.txt) using ROOM_ARENA flag
		Fish now can breathe in SECT_WATER/SECT_WATER_NOSWIM
		Wand of water breathing has use for non Bears! New Swim skill!
		Swim skill for all classes
		Steal bug is fixed! Still existed in Envy2.2! (act_obj.c)
		Retire command (suggested in sky.txt)
		new Director command "Delete" NUKES player on the fly!
		Increased the mana cost of remove alignment to 100 as in Envy2.0
		My new and improved CLANS code support! It works too :-)
		do_remove now allows things as: "remove #.ring"
		do_sacrifice now allows things as: "sacrifice #.something"
		  where # is the word "all" or a number.
		Added MOBPrograms from MOM_Envy.tar.gz, i had to change it a
		  bit (Envy1.0 source with bugs). But it works! Yeeepeee!
		Brew skill (creates potions). A bit altered by me.
		Scribe skill (creates scrolls). A bit altered by me.
		All ch's >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL may enter in any guild room.
		Added "show" bit to cmd_type so MOBProgram commands aren't
		  visible to regular players using the "commands" command.
		  It's his only use, to hide commands from "commands".
		Killing charmed mob without master bug fixed.
		Chain Lightning (Drool Co design) spell for Mages
		Detect Good spell for Clerics
		Dispel Good spell for Clerics
		Dirt Kicking skill for Warriors and Thieves
		Added several new liquid types
		Added ITEM_PORTAL, ITEM_WARP_STONE
		Added do_enter, so you can enter a portal and teleport.
		Added several new liquid types.
		Added Online Editing using ILAB OLC Beta 1.1! To port i used a
		  version of OLC for Envy2.0 by Christopher Smith
		  ( stoked@iastate.edu ) and another from MOM_Envy.tar.gz.
		Changed object format slightly... Will still load old Envy areas
		  but saves in the new format. The only diference this format
		  has is a new value[4] field necessary for ITEM_PORTAL, now
		  we have OLC we could completely change the format for area
		  files and still be able to convert old Envy areas!
		Added alias, and unalias commands! No more need to type such
		 lines as: cast 'lightning breath' executioner several times!
		Added CHANNEL_GRATS and "grats" command.
		Added CHANNEL_CLANTALK and "clantalk" command.
		Protection Good spell for Clerics.
		Fixed colorconv() bug when player was switched.
		Solved do_switch bug while in OLC. OLC prompt info does not
		appear while switched.

=== What's next?

I might finish and include these features in my next patch to EnvyMud.
These features are by NO MEANS guaranteed to be coded.

		Built in Client (If you use telnet like me it's great)
		A new class different from the others (no Paladins please)!
		Even more spells, even more skills.

=== What can i do to help?

  Please make suggestions, contribute with code or whatever. Whatever i do i
will try to make it available to everyone. And pass it to the EnvyMud staff.
All my code here is *freeware* but the snippets have their own author rights.
  PLEASE do not make code which requests who uses it to put your name on the
title screen as i have seen some code (like quest.c in ftp.solace.mh.se) i hate 
this! If everyone where like this soon we would have pages and pages of names in
the title screen... If you want put your name in the help of the skill or
whatever. To fight this i will include NO code which requests the author's name
in the title screen unless it's a MAJOR code change.

=== DISCLAIMER! ATTENTION!

  I have worked hard on this code and i ask you nothing for it. All i can 
say is that it works fine on my 16MB Pentium Linux system and without any 
warnings or errors, i have tested the code very throughly and found no 
bugs (yet). I tested it on an DEC-OSF and the only compile warnings are the 
same of Envy2.2. It runs fine afterwards. So i say to you this:
1. If this code blows up your machine it's not my fault.
2. If your girlfriend/boyfriend leaves you it's not my fault.
3. If while crossing the street you are hit by a car it's not my fault.
4. In short: USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
With that said if you report bugs i will *try* to solve them.


- Zen
