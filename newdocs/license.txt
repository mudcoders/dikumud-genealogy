=== DISCLAIMER! ATTENTION!

  I have worked hard on this code and i ask you nothing for it. All i can
say is that it works fine on my 16MB Pentium Linux system and without any 
warnings or errors, i have tested the code very throughly and found no
bugs (yet). So i say to you this:
1. If this code blows up your machine it's not my fault.
2. If your girlfriend/boyfriend leaves you it's not my fault.
3. If while crossing the street you are hit by a car it's not my fault.
4. In short: USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
With that said if you report bugs i will *try* to solve them.

=== License

All my code here is *freeware* but the snippets have their own author rights.
Also don't forget to follow the Envy, Merc and Diku licenses. You should find
them in the 'doc' directory.
